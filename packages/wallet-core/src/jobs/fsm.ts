/**
 * Job FSM — pure transition rules.
 *
 * No state ownership here. The journal service in `@nulo/extension` owns
 * records and persistence; this module just answers "is X → Y legal?".
 * That separation keeps the rule table testable without chrome.*, zod,
 * or service-collection wiring.
 *
 * Legal-transitions graph (active → terminal):
 *
 *   pending → simulating → proving → submitting → succeeded
 *      │          │ │         │           │
 *      │          │ └─── (no-prove shortcut: token_import etc.)
 *      └──────────┴───────────┴───────────┴── failed
 *      └──────────┴───────────┘
 *           (cancel only before submit)
 *
 * The `simulating → succeeded` shortcut is for ops that have no on-chain
 * effect (token imports, future no-prove imports). The journal
 * service enforces the kind ↔ txHash invariant: only `kind === "token_import"`
 * records may take this edge; `transfer`/`dapp_execute` must go through the
 * full prove + submit path.
 *
 * Terminal stages have no outgoing edges.
 *
 * Submit is the point-of-no-return: once we hand the tx to `sendTxTask` it
 * has been (or will be) broadcast to the mempool. A cancel that lands during
 * `submitting` can no longer prevent the on-chain effect, so admitting
 * `submitting → cancelled` would create a contradictory state in the journal
 * ("cancelled") vs. on-chain reality ("succeeded"). The transition is illegal;
 * `ExecutionService.cancelJob` treats the rejected transition as "too late"
 * and drops the cancel signal silently — the flow then proceeds to its
 * natural `succeeded` / `failed` terminal.

 * `toPayload` / `walletErrorFromPayload` plumbing.
 *
 * Lossy-cancel semantics: the journal is transitioned to
 * `cancelled` synchronously by `cancelJob()`; the SW-side prove pipeline
 * keeps running until its next AbortSignal checkpoint, at which point it
 * throws this sentinel and unwinds. The catch block recognises the
