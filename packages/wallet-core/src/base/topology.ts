 * Topological ordering for service startup.

 * `ServiceCollection.start()` used to Promise.all everything; each service

 * dep that wasn't ready yet. Cycles showed up as mysterious timeouts.
 *
 * This module computes phases from each service's declared `dependencies`.
 * Services in the same phase start in parallel; phases run sequentially.
 * A cycle surfaces as a named error, not a hang.
 *
 * Pure function with no runtime coupling — see topology.test.ts.
