/** Force-release timeout for stuck readers (ms). Converts a deadlock into a
 *  loud log + forced drain so the wallet recovers on its own instead of
 *  hanging forever — a DEBUGGABILITY backstop for reentry, NOT a mechanism
 *  for a writer to force past live work.
 *
 *  It MUST exceed the longest legitimate reader, and a profile-barrier reader's
 *  lifetime is NOT just its own proof: the PxeService holds the profile READ
 *  across the wait for the inner per-chain guard, so a chain op can sit ~30 min
 *  queued behind another chain's proof and THEN prove ~30 min itself (a 35-min
 *  ceiling force-released the queued-then-proving reader and let a delete overlap it). 90 min covers queue-behind-one-proof + own-proof
 *  + margin; the delete path itself now WAITS behind the proof (its clear ops got
 *  the proof-length request timeout) rather than relying on this force-release. */

/**
 * Read/write concurrency guard.
 *
 * - `read(fn)`: counts as a reader. Runs immediately if no writer is
 *   active or queued; otherwise waits for the writer to finish. Multiple
 *   concurrent reads proceed in parallel.
 * - `write(fn)`: waits for all active readers to drain, then runs
 *   exclusively. Other readers and writers queue behind it.
 * - `enterWrite()`/`leaveWrite()`: manual write-hold for destructive ops
 *   that span multiple awaits (profile switch/delete).
 *
 * Writers have FIFO priority: a reader arriving while a writer is queued
 * waits behind that writer. This prevents writer starvation under heavy
 * read load.
 *
 * Force-release: if readers don't drain within `MAX_READER_DRAIN_MS`,
 * the guard logs an error and force-unsticks queued writers. This is a
 * debuggability aid — it should never fire in practice.
 *
 * Reentry: calling `write()` from within a `read()` callback will
 * deadlock (the write waits for the read to finish; the read can't
 * finish until the write returns). The force-release unsticks this
 * after `MAX_READER_DRAIN_MS` (35 minutes). MV3 lacks
 * `AsyncLocalStorage`, so we don't detect reentry statically — the
 * sync-detector approach produces false positives under legitimate
 * concurrent reads vs. writes. Callers must not nest.

	 *  decrementing a fresh count to -1 (which let writers overlap later live
	 *  readers). PER-TOKEN ages matter: the force-release must expire only
	 *  readers INDIVIDUALLY stuck past the ceiling — serialized long readers
