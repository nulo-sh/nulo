/**
 * Thin shared wrapper for the `chrome.alarms` ritual that four SW
 * components hand-rolled independently — the alarm-name constant, `create`/
 * `clear`, and a name-filtered `onAlarm` dispatch that routes the tick's
 * rejection to an error handler.
 *
 * It owns ONLY that ritual: name + create/clear + name-guarded dispatch wiring.
 * It is deliberately **logger-agnostic** — the caller supplies `onError`, so
 * each site keeps its own diagnostic verbatim (a shared generic message would
 * change observable behavior, and a generic backstop would double-report when a
 * caller's own error handler throws). Scheduling (periodic `periodInMinutes` vs
 * one-shot `when`), any boot-time reconcile run, and any enabled-gating stay
 * with the caller — those differ per site and do not generalize (a period-bundling
 * primitive does NOT fit `session-manager`'s `when`-based reschedule-under-lock). `create()` forwards
 * the full {@link AlarmCreateOptions}; `listen()` is optional (a caller with a
 * centralized external dispatch path skips it).
