	 * Callers must pass a concrete `MinimalStorageArea` (e.g.
	 * `browserApi.storage.local`, `chrome.storage.session`, or
	 * `FakeBrowserApi`'s fake) explicitly from the composition root. No
	 * legacy enum form is supported.
	 *
	 * `parse` is an OPTIONAL boundary codec: `(raw: unknown) => T` (e.g. a zod
	 * schema's `parse`). When omitted, reads keep the legacy `JSON.parse(...) as T`
	 * behavior (no validation). When provided, every read validates the parsed
	 * JSON. Both JSON-SYNTAX failure and CODEC-VALIDATION failure KEEP the row
	 * (return undefined; the read path never deletes — see `decodeRow`).
	 * wallet-core carries no zod itself; the schema is injected from the app layer.
	 *
	 * `requireKeyIdentityMatch` opts a root into the id/key consistency guard: a row whose
	 * embedded `id` disagrees with the storage-key suffix reads as undefined. Only roots whose
	 * SECURITY decisions trust the embedded id enable this — several roots legitimately key rows
	 * by something other than the entity id (e.g. dapp sessions keyed per context).
	 *
	 * `keyIdentityMode` picks how the embedded id must match the suffix:
	 *   - `"string"` (default): embedded id must be a STRING byte-equal to the suffix. For roots
	 *     whose ids are hex strings (profiles).
	 *   - `"numeric"`: the embedded id must be a POSITIVE SAFE INTEGER whose canonical decimal
	 *     form equals the suffix (`Number.isSafeInteger(embedded) && embedded >= 1`). For roots
	 *     minting sequence ids via `array_max(existing) + 1`, whose smallest honest id is 1 —
	 *     negative/fractional/exponential hostiles would otherwise alias (`-0` → "0",
	 *     `1e21` poisons future id allocation).
