/**
 * The data-preserving migration engine (pure, `chrome.*`-free).
 *
 * Applies numbered migrations where `version > persisted`, under a durable
 * crash-safe journal so a service-worker kill at ANY point converges on the
 * next boot:
 *
 *   1. set `running`               ← run-scoped UI barrier (whole run, no gaps)
 *   2. per migration N:
 *      a. set `backup={version,refs,entries}` ← single atomic key: all-or-nothing
 *      b. run migration.up()       ← writes accumulate in a staging buffer
 *      c. guard + commit the diff  ← staged keys must be inside declared writes
 *      d. set `version=N`          ← checkpoint (1…N-1 stay durable)
 *      e. clear backup
 *   3. stamp max, clear `running`
 *
 * Resume on boot with `running` set:
 *   - valid backup + `version >= backup.version` ⇒ the commit+stamp completed;
 *     clear the journal WITHOUT restoring (restoring here would silently revert
 *     committed data underneath the new version marker).
 *   - valid backup + `version < backup.version` ⇒ interrupted mid-migration;
 *     restore the declared footprint from the backup, then clear + re-run.
 *   - no backup ⇒ the crash predated any write; clear + proceed.
 *   - PRESENT-but-invalid backup ⇒ tampering/corruption (the backup is written
 *     as one atomic set, so a prep-crash cannot produce a partial one); fail
 *     closed to `needs-recovery`, journal kept.
 *
 * A failure inside a migration restores + clears the journal IMMEDIATELY (not
 * just on the next boot): the boot that continues past a non-breaking failure
 * must not leave `running` set, or every UI storage access would park on the
 * barrier forever. A throw never advances `version`. Durable attempt counters
 * (stored under the engine's own reserved namespace, never inside a footprint)
 * bound both the up() retries and the restore retries across boots.
