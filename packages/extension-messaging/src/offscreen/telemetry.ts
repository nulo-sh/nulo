/**
 * Offscreen `ServiceClient` telemetry surface.
 *
 * Pure observability — NOT durable recovery. Every request that the
 * client tracks emits exactly one terminal-status event. Callers wire
 * a `TelemetrySink` at construction; the default is
 * `LoggingTelemetrySink` so production builds get DevTools observability
 * for the offscreen relay without any caller-side wiring. Tests pass
 * `MemoryTelemetrySink` or `NoopTelemetrySink` explicitly to override.
 *
 * ## Data sensitivity (user-flagged)
 *
 * Telemetry events are SAFE METADATA only. The runtime path goes through
 * `sanitizeTelemetry()` before any sink hand-off:
 *
 *   ALLOWED:
 *     - method   (string, e.g. "getGasBalances") — already exposed as
 *       a service method name; not sensitive.
 *     - requestId (number) — internal correlation id; not sensitive.
 *     - startedAtMs / endedAtMs (epoch-ms) — timing only.
 *     - status (RequestTerminalStatus enum) — bounded set.
 *     - detail (string, optional) — sanitized into a STATIC error
 *       category. Untrusted error.message strings, stack traces, and
 *       payload bytes are NEVER passed through.
 *
 *   DISALLOWED (stripped):
 *     - request params, response data, error.message, error.stack, IDs
 *       that could correlate to user identity, network addresses,
 *       balances, encrypted blobs, etc.
 *
 * Sinks MUST call `sanitizeTelemetry()` before logging. The
 * `LoggingTelemetrySink` does this; production sinks must follow.
