// base.css is HAND-AUTHORED — a verbatim flatten of the extension's former SCSS partials.
// Unlike tokens.ts and utilities.css (generated + drift-pinned), nothing else pins
// it, yet it carries the look-same risk: token values, the [theme] blocks, @font-face, resets,
// keyframes, .material-symbols-outlined. A dropped or edited rule changes rendering with no test
// failure. This pin makes every edit deliberate: a real change updates the hash in the same
// commit, where the diff gets re-verified against the pixel-identical constraint.

	// Firefox matches Chrome; the dark palette is declared once (`:root, [theme="dark"]`), its hairline
	// and scrim tokens at their literals' values; line 1 carries the Apache-2.0 §4(b) header.
