/**
 * @nulo/design — the brutalist design system shared across Nulo apps.
 *
 * Tokens are a typed reflection of the CSS variables declared in base.css.
 * Import the global stylesheet once at app entry: `import "@nulo/design/base.css"`.
 * Components are exported as Vue SFC source; the consumer's Vite pipeline compiles them.
 *
 * Fonts are package-owned (`src/fonts`, referenced package-relative from base.css); the consumer's
 * Vite bundles them. There is NO auto-import in this package — every component, Vue API, and helper
 * uses explicit imports, so it compiles under any consumer's Vite config, auto-import or not.
 *
 * Presentational only: components take their data + any `data-testid` via props.
 * They never import app-specific utilities, stores, or service clients.
