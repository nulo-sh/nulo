SQLite itself is in the public domain; the bundle header reproduced below is upstream's own statement of that and of the Emscripten runtime's terms. Upstream builds it from the sqlite3mc amalgamation with the default cipher set and none of the optional extensions (no miniz). Of the code that amalgamation compiles in, what is neither sqlite3mc's own MIT code nor public domain or CC0 has its own entry: sha2, libaegis and Argon2.
