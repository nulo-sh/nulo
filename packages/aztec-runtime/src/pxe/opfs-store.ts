/**
 * Per-(profileId, chainId) ENCRYPTED SQLite-OPFS stores for the offscreen PXE.
 *
 * Why injection is mandatory (never the upstream default): 5.0.0's default `createStore` ignores
 * `dataDirectory` and opens ONE hardcoded-name store in the default OPFS SAH-pool directory — under
 * this wallet's one-PXE-per-(profile, chain) architecture that would collapse every profile and
 * chain into a single database, WIPE it on every rollup switch (the version stamp is per-store),
 * and deadlock concurrent PXEs on the pool's exclusive directory lock. Each store here gets its own
 * `poolDirectory` (the persisted `chainDataDir` coordinate), so isolation, concurrency, and purge
 * are all per-(profile, chain).
 *
 * Encryption: every store opens with a 32-byte per-profile ChaCha20 key (sqlite3mc via upstream's
 * `encryptionKey` — see `@nulo/wallet-crypto`'s `derivePxeStoreKey`). Fail-closed: no key, no
 * store. Purge is crypto-erase plus unlink.
 *
 * Version/rollup hygiene: against the same `dbVersion` singleton key upstream uses, we REFUSE to
 * open a store whose stamp mismatches the target schema/rollup — matching upstream 5.0.1's
 * refuse-and-preserve flip (5.0.0's `initStoreForRollupAndSchemaVersion` WIPED; 5.0.1 does not) and
 * the decision that the store holds user-owned state and the rollupAddress input is
 * node-derived, so wiping on it would let a lying RPC loop-destroy local stores). A mismatch throws
 * `PxeStoreVersionMismatch` and the caller fails chain-init; pre-production remediation = profile
 * purge. `PXE_DATA_SCHEMA_VERSION_PIN` mirrors upstream's non-exported constant; `opfs-store.test.ts`
 * asserts it against the installed package so a silent upstream bump fails the build.
 * A wrong store key surfaces as `SqliteEncryptionError` from upstream — mapped to a typed
 * `WrongStoreKeyError` (never confused with corruption or absence).
