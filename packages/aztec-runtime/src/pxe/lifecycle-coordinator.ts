/**
 * The per-chain purge-epoch fence, extracted from `PxeService`'s
 * god-class. Owns the epoch counter and the fence operations that were
 * duplicated byte-for-byte across `withPxeRead` and `withPxeWrite` (the read path
 * fenced chain-resurrection first; the write path grew the same fence later).
 * Centralizing it gives that fence one home, so a third op path can't
 * re-introduce the bug by forgetting to copy the check.
 *
 * The invariant: `clearChainState` {@link bump}s a chain's
 * epoch at BOTH ends of its destructive section, so an in-flight op that
 * captured the prior value via {@link current} cannot RESURRECT a just-purged
 * chain — its write-rebind step would otherwise re-create the runtime + a fresh
 * OPFS store dir for a chain whose network row is gone (nothing ever removes
 * that dir again). A read that entered BEFORE the purge refuses to rebind (its
 * {@link assertUnchanged} throws); a new op after the purge sees the new epoch
 * at entry and may legitimately re-create.
