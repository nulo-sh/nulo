/**
 * Provenance pins for the first-tx wrap decision: `outMeta.
 * initializesAccount` must be true iff THIS build wrapped the account ctor.
 * The flag gates the send-path existing-nullifier classification — the pins
 * red if the assignments are dropped (the classification then never fires,
 * or fires without provenance).
 *
 * Real account (node env runs the actual derivation); the node/pxe/entrypoint
 * surfaces are stubbed at the instance seam — the subject is the DECISION and
 * its out-param, not the request assembly.
