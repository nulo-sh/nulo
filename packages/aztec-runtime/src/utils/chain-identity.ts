 * Live-node chain identity verification.

 * The wallet trusts `node.getNodeInfo()` for `(l1ChainId, rollupVersion)` at every
 * signing/proving boundary. A malicious or drifted RPC endpoint could otherwise change
 * the chain context after enrollment and have the account sign against a chain the user
 * never selected. `assertLiveChainIdentity` compares the live pair to the stored network
 * and throws on any drift; apply it at every site that has BOTH the stored network AND
 * the live node response in scope, before `chainInfoFrom`. A site that needs only the
 * `ChainInfo` calls `liveChainInfo`, which does both.
 *
 * NOT applied inside `nulo-account.ts:buildTxExecutionRequest` (no network in scope) —
 * every caller of that method asserts first.
