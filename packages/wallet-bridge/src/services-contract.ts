/**
 * Structural service interfaces consumed by the wallet-sdk dispatcher.
 *
 * The dispatcher deliberately does NOT import the concrete service
 * classes (`NetworkService`, `AccountService`, …). Those live in
 * `@nulo/extension` and are not reachable from `wallet-bridge`. The
 * dispatcher depends on these interfaces; the real services satisfy
 * them structurally at the wiring site (`background.ts`).
 *
 * These are narrowed CONSUMER interfaces — they declare only the methods
 * and parameters the dispatcher actually uses, not exact mirrors of each
 * service's full public API. Extra optional parameters on the real
 * services (e.g. `AccountService.getAccounts`'s `all?: boolean`,
 * `ExecutionService.executeOperations`'s `parentTask?: WrappedTask`) are
 * fine — concrete implementations stay assignable via TypeScript's
 * function-parameter bivariance for optional trailing params.
 *
 * Domain types (`INetworkRef`, `IAccountRef`, `IDappSessionRef`,
 * `Operation`, `OperationResult`, …) all live in `@nulo/wallet-bridge`.

 * request necessarily enqueues strictly behind this one, so execution order is
 * preserved while popups still open concurrently. `queuedJournalId` lets the
 * message-arrival layer pass a pre-allocated journal id (so the in-flight
 * surface is visible in the activity feed before the handler runs).
 *
 * `originKey` is the canonical browser origin of the calling dApp (NOT a display
 * name or sessionId). It scopes the per-origin execution-mutex backpressure cap
 * so one dApp can't monopolize the shared `(profileId, chainId)` lane and starve
 * another. The dispatcher sets it from `ctx.origin` on every sendTx.
 *
 * Kept as a structural type so wallet-bridge doesn't import from the extension
 * package. The extension's `ExecutionHooks` aliases this type directly, so the
 * field set stays in lockstep across the layer boundary.
