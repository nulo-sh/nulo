 *   - `requiresFeeSelection` — the UX gate the popup runs before executing; if a
 *     send-like still needs the user to pick a fee method, the row never leaves

 *   - `assertExecutableOperation` — a TS assertion that narrows `DraftOperation`
 *     to `Operation` (throws if a send-like reached it with no `feeSettings`),
 *     so the compiler treats the value as executable afterwards.
