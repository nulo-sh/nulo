/**
 * Branded secret + wire-encoding types. Each brand is a nominal `unique symbol`
 * intersection — the TYPES erase at emit (no bytes). The `as*` mint helpers are runtime
 * IDENTITY functions (`(b) => b as X`): one trivial, trivially-inlinable call per mint that
 * returns the same reference — NO allocation, NO byte change, NO control-flow or zeroization
 * delta, so behavior stays byte-identical. (They're functions, not erased casts, on purpose:
 * a single named mint per value is grep-auditable — the one sanctioned boundary where a raw
 * value acquires the brand.) Consumed at the typed sinks — stopping the class of bug where a
 * base64 string, a ciphertext, a credential id, or a raw byte-array is passed into the wrong
 * slot and only fails at decrypt/restore time.
 *
 * NOT classes (would change runtime identity → break Web Crypto / `Buffer` / `Fr.fromBuffer`
 * / `zeroize`). NOT `zod.brand()` (this package has no zod dep; branding must be zero-runtime).
 * `zeroize<T extends Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer>` stays structurally compatible with the
 * byte-array brands, so zeroization is unchanged. A brand widens to its base for free
 * (`Base64CredentialId` → `string` needs no cast), so branding a producer does NOT force every
 * downstream base-typed param to become branded — only the origin mints.
 *
 * ## Scope
 * Seven brands, each applied from mint to consume. First group:
 * `Passhash`, `MasterSecretBytes`, and the WebAuthn ceremony shuttle `Base64CredentialId` /
 * `Base64SecretPrf` / `HexUserHandle` — where the silent `id`↔`prf` transposition (both base64,
 * both `string` today) is the one catastrophic swap. Second group (the restore-payload split): the
 * `Base64Ciphertext` ↔ `Base64MasterSecret` PAIR — an on-disk AES-GCM ciphertext vs. a decrypted
 * base64 plain master key. They only earn their keep together, at the polymorphic `master-key` /
 * `exportPlain` / `exportEncrypted` boundary where one `string` slot legitimately carries a
 * ciphertext, a plain secret, or a credential id and only a runtime length/`!==` check guards it.
 * `Salt` is deliberately NOT branded: the PBKDF2 / HKDF salt is a private
 * local (`EncryptionKey.deriveKey`, `PasskeyCredential.salt`) that never crosses a function
 * boundary, so a brand would guard zero call sites.
 *
 * `PasskeyCredential.create` intentionally accepts an UNbranded `{ id; prf; userHandle? }` and
 * mints onto its branded fields: the swap is already caught upstream at the ceremony mint + the
 * branded `PasskeyCredentialData` shuttle, and this keeps the frozen `key-vectors.test.ts`
 * oracle (which calls `create` with plain-string fixtures) byte-unedited.
