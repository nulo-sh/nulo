/**
 * Executable entropy accounting for the one lossy step in NULO-ACCOUNT-KDF v2: reducing a
 * uniformly random byte string into the BN254 scalar field (`Fr.fromBufferReduce`).
 *
 * Reduction mod `p` is never perfectly uniform when the input range is not a multiple of `p`:
 * some residues get one more preimage than others, so the most likely master is slightly more
 * likely than the least. How much that costs is ARITHMETIC, not judgement — and it is the number
 * that decides how wide the reduce input has to be. Every other statement of it in this codebase
 * is prose in a comment, which is exactly the kind of claim that rots silently. This computes it.
 *
 * The figures are derived here from `p` and the input width, then pinned. Narrowing any reduce
 * input reds this file with the exact bit loss, rather than shipping a quietly weaker master.
