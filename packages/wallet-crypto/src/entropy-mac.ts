/**
 * MAC over the ENTIRE sealed-secret envelope PLUS the row's identity — the tamper +
 * transplant + identity-swap check, verified at BOTH password unlock and silent (bearer)
 * restore.
 *
 * Without it, an attacker with storage write access could (a) tamper the sealed entropy so a
 * long-lived bearer keeps operating while recovery silently degrades, (b) transplant a single
 * authentic ciphertext (e.g. the `secret` slot) from ANOTHER profile that shares the password,
 * or (c) swap a WHOLE envelope between same-password profiles — the purpose-AADs stop (b)'s
 * cross-slot moves but neither same-slot moves nor (c).
 *
 * KEYED BY `HKDF(master ‖ dek)`, not by the master alone: the threat model's attacker HOLDS
 * the shared master (two profiles from one recovery phrase derive the same one), so a
 * master-keyed tag is forgeable BY THEM — forging additionally requires the victim's DEK, the
 * exact secret the DEK design keeps from them.
 *
 * The v3 preimage binds `profileId` FIRST and `walletFingerprint` LAST. The id kills the
 * whole-envelope swap: the tag is computed over the row's OWN storage key, so B's authentic
 * envelope pasted into A's row fails verification even though every field — including the
 * original tag — is byte-authentic. The fingerprint closes the same hole for the plaintext
 * duplicate-guard field: blinding it (to silence the duplicate warning) is now a detectable
 * tamper. Both fields are non-secret; binding them costs nothing and removes the last
 * unauthenticated inputs a storage writer could steer.
 *
 * A mismatch never profile-blocks: it opens a session WITHOUT the DEK — recovery mode. Nothing
 * keyed by the DEK is available (imported keys, the PXE store key, the dApp-session key — so
 * chain operations wait for the repair) and no bearer is persisted, but the derived keys stay
 * exportable and the backup export stays open: a storage writer cannot lock the user out of
 * the funds their phrase controls.
 *
 * Uses `globalThis.crypto` for the same cross-env reason as `mnemonic-master.ts`.
