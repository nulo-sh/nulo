# CI guide

Contributor-facing reference for what runs when, how to opt in to slow gates, how to release, and how to debug a failing PR. The implementation details (workflow YAMLs, composite actions, reusables) live in [`.github/`](./.github/); the design rationale lives in [`implementations-plan/archive/ci-cd/`](./implementations-plan/archive/ci-cd/).

## Branch model

- **`main`** — stable. Hot off this branch is the version we'd ship to users.
- **`dev`** — integration trunk. Day-to-day PRs land here.
- **Feature branches** (`feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`, `chore/...`) — short-lived, PR'd into `dev`. Auto-deleted on merge.
- **No long-lived feature branches.** A `dev → main` PR is the "promote to stable" step.

## What runs when

| Trigger | Workflow(s) | Wall time |
|---|---|---|
| Push to a feature branch (no PR) | local pre-commit hook only (biome + commitlint) | <1 s |
| Open / sync PR to `dev` | `pr-quick` always; `pr-extension-smoke-e2e` + `pr-extension-network-e2e` when their filters trip or their label is set | 3–10 min (`pr-quick`); +5–10 min each if smoke / network triggers |
| Open / sync PR to `main` | all three workflows above run unconditionally | 15–25 min total |
| Add the `e2e:extension-smoke` or `e2e:extension-network` label | the corresponding workflow runs (removing the label re-evaluates) | as above |
| Push to `main` | `release.yml` (release-please opens or updates a Release PR; merging it tags + creates the GitHub Release + attaches built artifacts) | 1–2 min for the PR refresh; 15–25 min for the publish run after merge |
| Click "Run workflow" on `release.yml` | re-publish artifacts for an existing tag (escape hatch) | 15–25 min |
| Click "Run workflow" on `publish-packages.yml` | test, stage, pack and digest-check the three npm packages; publish and verify them only with `dry_run` false and the `npm-publish` environment approved | 3–5 min |

### `pr-quick.yml`

Always runs on every PR. Lightweight gates:

- `commitlint` — Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, …; lower-case subject, 100-char header cap). On PRs to `dev`: every commit in `base..head`. On PRs to `main`: **skipped** — the promote PR's merge subject is an intentional non-conventional release-note line (`release: promote dev → main …`, > 100 chars, no `release` type by design), the bot Release PR (`chore(main): release X.Y.Z`) is reliably conventional anyway, and the dev squash subjects in the range are already-merged + immutable (re-linting them can only fail the required check on a long subject, never fix it).
- `lint-and-typecheck` — biome over the repo + `bun run typecheck:all` (vue-tsc across all packages).
- `unit-tests` — `bun run test:all` (vitest across all workspaces; `--if-present` skips only `playground`, which has no `test` script — `landing` has one and runs). Every workspace `test` script is `bun --bun vitest run`, so the suites execute on the pinned Bun (`setup-bun`), not on the runner image's ambient Node; the Puppeteer e2e jobs still run vitest under Node.
- `build-extension` — chrome + firefox builds, both on every PR that builds the extension, uploaded as the `extension-chrome` / `extension-firefox` artifacts (7-day retention) with the version stamped `X.Y.Z-pr.<N>` (`version_suffix`). The advisory `preview-comment` job keeps ONE sticky comment on the PR linking to them, edited in place on every push (a run whose head the PR has since moved past leaves the comment alone, so a slow run never overwrites a newer one) — download, unzip, **Load unpacked**. Same-repo PRs only; `continue-on-error` and not in `quality-status`'s `needs`, so it can red neither the run nor the gate. Logic in `scripts/ci-cd/preview-comment.ts`.

The `quality-status` aggregator at the end is the required check on `main` / `dev` branch protection (the bare job/check-run name; a `Workflow / Job` context such as `Quality / Status` never matches a produced check — see [CLAUDE.md § Branching](./CLAUDE.md#branching--merging) and `implementations-plan/archive/required-check-mismatch/`). Like the e2e aggregators it is an exact state machine, not a list of bad results: `Detect changes` must succeed, its build flags must read `true` or `false`, and every gate must end as its own `if:` asks (`success` when it runs, `skipped` only where its condition did not hold: a build whose filter did not trip, or commitlint on a manual dispatch), so a gate that never ran fails the check.

### `pr-extension-smoke-e2e.yml`

Runs the smoke e2e suite (`vitest.e2e.config.ts`) as a **3-shard matrix**, each runner a fixed third of the files by vitest's SHA-1-of-path split, because a whole Firefox run neared the 30-minute job limit; the Firefox twin runs the same shards. No Aztec sandbox; just puppeteer driving the popup UI.

Triggers:
- **Always** on PRs to `main`
- **Auto** on PRs to `dev` whose diff touches the `smoke-surface` paths-filter (popup, components, manifest, the wallet services smoke exercises, build inputs, the harness, etc. — see [`pr-extension-smoke-e2e.yml`](./.github/workflows/pr-extension-smoke-e2e.yml) `filters:`)
- **Manual** by adding the `e2e:extension-smoke` label

`extension-smoke-e2e-status` emits `pass` when the suite is skipped (no relevant changes / no label), so branch protection sees a green check either way. When the suite runs, GitHub hands the aggregator the three shards as one result, so a failed or cancelled shard reds it; re-run a red lane with "Re-run failed jobs", never one shard ([`follow-ups.md`](./implementations-plan/follow-ups.md) records why). It is a **required** check on both `dev` and `main` (see "Check names and the protection runbook").

### `pr-extension-network-e2e.yml`

Runs the network e2e suite (anvil + Aztec sandbox + playground + the extension build) as a **5-shard parallel matrix** — each shard owns its own sandbox + about a fifth of the 108 test files (deterministic SHA-1-of-filename distribution). Wall time ~10–15 min (vs ~35–45 min unsharded). Same trigger shape as `pr-extension-smoke-e2e`, but with the `extension-network` filter (network-touching wallet code, runtime, `wallet-bridge`, playground, etc.) and the `e2e:extension-network` label. See [`apps/extension/tests/e2e/README.md`](./apps/extension/tests/e2e/README.md#ci-sharding-5-way-matrix) for the shard-design rationale.

#### Presto in CI

Each prover-ON network-e2e lane installs and starts the headless **`presto-server`** binary (from the [`alejoamiras/presto`](https://github.com/alejoamiras/presto) repo) before the test agent fires. The wallet build is stamped with `VITE_NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED=1` so [`chain-runtime.ts`](./packages/aztec-runtime/src/pxe/chain-runtime.ts) constructs `ProductionPxeFactory` in **required-mode** — proving traffic MUST hit presto-server natively, never silently fall back to in-browser WASM. Required mode is also the only place plaintext HTTP is representable: the headless server is HTTP-only, so the factory derives `httpsOnly: false` from the mode; production always passes `httpsOnly: true`. Layered enforcement:

- **Layer 1** (workflow) — `/health` preflight gates the run on `bb_available == true`. Server missing or unhealthy → red.
- **Layer 2** (wallet) — `chain-runtime.ts` does an eager `checkPrestoStatus()` at PXE creation (the error names the SDK's `reason` and, for `secure-connection-unavailable`, its `diagnosis`) + installs an `onPhase` guard that throws on `fallback` / `denied` / `secure-connection-unavailable` / `version-mismatch`. This is the per-test authority.
- **Layer 3** (workflow) — post-test step counts `Received /prove request` and `Proving succeeded` lines in `/tmp/presto-server.log`, prints `PROVE_SUCCESS=<n>` and a step-summary table, and **fails a `canary*` lane** when there were zero successful native proofs. On soak/dispatch lanes (`shard_label: soak-N`) it only reports — the in-test assertion in `tx-sendTx-default` (`data-backend="presto"` + the exact subtitle, keyed on the build stamp) is what a prover-ON soak enforces.

**Production behavior.** `VITE_NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED` is only set in `_extension-network-e2e.yml`, and [`_build-extension.yml`](./.github/workflows/_build-extension.yml) fails a production build whose bundle carries `NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED_BUILD_STAMP`. Production builds prove over HTTPS only (Presto's desktop app serves `https://127.0.0.1:59834` once its Encrypted Connection setup is done) with the SDK's silent WASM fallback for users without Presto.

**Rollback flags** (both require repo write access; PR authors cannot toggle):
- `vars.NULO_E2E_DISABLE_PRESTO=1` (Settings → Variables) — the emergency kill switch, affects all PR + dispatch runs until cleared.
- `workflow_dispatch` input `disable_presto: true` — single-run override for investigation.

**Origin gate.** The server denies non-localhost browser origins by default, and the wallet proves from `chrome-extension://<id>` — unknowable before Chrome loads the unpacked build — so the start step sets `PRESTO_ALLOW_ALL=1` on the **server process only** (never at job level). Safe on a loopback-only server on a single-tenant, ephemeral runner where fork PRs receive no secrets; never on a self-hosted runner. It bypasses Presto's per-origin approval prompt by design — that path is exercised by the manual Mac check, not CI.

**Release-metadata token.** Before downloading a `bb` version it has not cached, Presto looks up that release asset's published SHA-256 on the GitHub API and refuses to run an unverified prover. Anonymous callers share a 60-request-per-hour budget keyed to the source address, which Actions runners exhaust between themselves; the lookup then fails with `Cannot verify bb v<x>: no digest available from GitHub API` and the shard produces no proofs at all. The start step therefore passes the workflow's own `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` to the **server process only**, under a renamed variable so it does not reach the rest of the step. Read access to a public repository's releases is the whole requirement, so the default token is enough and a fork PR's read-only one works too. Presto refuses redirects on that request (alejoamiras/presto#46), so the credential reaches `api.github.com` and nowhere else. A cached version needs no lookup, so this matters on the first run after a `bb` bump or a cold cache. **The token needs `presto-server` ≥ 1.1.2** (CI pins 1.1.3): 1.1.1 sent the lookup with no `Authorization` header and ignored the variable, so the canary failed intermittently with the message above — each failed proof a failed test. A pin below that line makes the lookup anonymous again. When requests outnumber proofs, the assert step prints the server's WARN/ERROR lines in the job log and the step summary; the full log is in the `network-e2e-logs-<shard>` failure artifact (`e2e-testing` skill, flake ledger row 31).

**Coexistence.** Presto and the retired Aztec Accelerator desktop app share the wire protocol on the same port: a still-running Accelerator answers a Presto client and the wallet cannot tell them apart. Quit or uninstall Aztec Accelerator before installing Presto.

**Bumping presto-server**: update `version`, `expected_tarball_sha256` and `expected_sha256` in `.github/workflows/_extension-network-e2e.yml`'s `setup-presto-server` step together. Both hashes are computed locally from the release assets; the `.sha256` sidecar from the same release is a transfer-integrity check, not a security boundary. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md#binary-dependencies).

#### Proverless network e2e (the two-build split)

Most network-e2e files run against a **proverless** wallet build (`_extension-network-e2e.yml` input `proverless: true` → `NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS=1`): [`chain-runtime.ts`](./packages/aztec-runtime/src/pxe/chain-runtime.ts) sets `proverEnabled:false`, so the PXE skips BB-SNARK generation — kernel simulation + on-chain submission stay real, and the local node accepts the fake `ChonkProof.random()` proof. This makes the shard pool fast and CDP-stable. Presto is forced OFF for proverless jobs (`proverless` ⊥ `VITE_NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED`).

A few **STUB** tests (`cancel-mid-prove`, `concurrent-sendtx-{approve,confirm}`) need a controllable prove window — proverless prove collapses to sub-second, too fast to observe sequencing/cancel. They run proverless and drive a `ProofGate` (a `chrome.storage.session` barrier, key `nulo:e2e:proof-gate`, injected into the **SW** `ExecutionCoordinator.proveTxTask` — the offscreen document has no `chrome.storage`) to hold the tx at `proving` deterministically, then release.

**Real BB proving stays covered** by the `network-e2e-canary` job (prover-ON, presto-server), on Chrome and on Firefox: `transfers` (wallet UI, waits through real prove → mine) + `tx-sendTx-default` (dApp, waits through real prove → submit — the node validates a real proof at `node.sendTx`; playground hard-codes `wait: "NO_WAIT"` so block-mine isn't awaited) + the two execution canaries (`frozen-account-canary`, `passkey-execution-canary` — the `@aztec` bump gate, CLAUDE.md "Account-address freeze") + `delete-after-prove` (a dApp `profileTx` loads bb.js's CRS cache, a real prove, then the proving profile is deleted). The job's `Assert canary results` step reads vitest's json report back against `scripts/ci-cd/canary-expectations.json`, so a listed file that never ran, a skipped test or a vanished canary is a red job.

**Production safety.** `NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS` is a **double-opt-in** build flag (`VITE_NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS` + `VITE_NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS_CONFIRM`; fail-closed throw if exactly one is set). The proverless branch + barrier are dead-code-eliminated from prod (referenced only inside `if (E2E_PROVERLESS)`); [`_build-extension.yml`](./.github/workflows/_build-extension.yml) asserts the build stamp + `nulo:e2e:proof-gate` key are ABSENT from every shipped `dist/{chrome,firefox}`. See [`implementations-plan/archive/e2e-proverless-stub/`](./implementations-plan/archive/e2e-proverless-stub/plan.md).

### `pr-extension-smoke-e2e-firefox.yml` / `pr-extension-network-e2e-firefox.yml`

The two extension suites again, on Firefox. Each is a twin of its Chrome caller — same paths filter (re-pointed at its own file, plus `.github/actions/setup-geckodriver/**`), same labels, same shard / heavy / canary shape — calling the same reusable workflow with `browser: firefox`, which adds [`setup-geckodriver`](./.github/actions/setup-geckodriver/action.yml) (SHA-256-pinned tarball + binary), installs the Firefox revision the locked Puppeteer pins, builds `dist/firefox` and runs the suite with `NULO_E2E_BROWSER=firefox`. Differences from the Chrome callers, all deliberate: **draft PRs skip** (the gate's first test; `ready_for_review` re-runs it), `pull-requests: read` is granted to the `changes` job only, and two files skip whole-file on Firefox (one kills the background under an open extension page, which Firefox declines; one redirects over CDP Fetch, which Firefox lacks). The canary job runs the same four prover-ON files on both browsers — the two send specs and the two execution canaries — and its `Assert canary results` step reads vitest's json report back against `scripts/ci-cd/canary-expectations.json`, so a canary that skipped, vanished or never ran reds the job whatever the file count said; `behavior-gating.test.ts` pins every lane's lists, the prover-ON input, the pool partition and the aggregators' result loops. Aggregators: `extension-smoke-e2e-firefox-status`, `extension-network-e2e-firefox-status`, the same exact-state shape.

**Required on `dev`; the smoke one on `main` too.** The two PR aggregators (`extension-smoke-e2e-firefox-status`, `extension-network-e2e-firefox-status`) are required on `dev`, and `main` requires the smoke one; the network one is advisory there. Each passes when its lane is skipped (no matching paths, or a draft PR; `ready_for_review` re-runs it). `nightly.yml` runs its Firefox jobs (`network-e2e*-firefox`, `smoke-firefox-against-artifact`) outside every aggregator's and publish step's `needs`. The one exception is `release.yml`'s `smoke-firefox-against-artifact`: `attach-assets` and `status` wait on it, so a red one holds the release's assets. A red advisory job still turns the *run* red — read the `status` job. The lanes are not free: on a PR that trips both filters the two workflows start seventeen more jobs (eleven suites, six control) that queue against the required lanes for the same runners, and `release.yml`'s Firefox smoke holds the `release` concurrency slot until it ends (a 45-minute execution timeout; time queued for a runner is on top), so it can also delay the *next* release. `scripts/ci-cd/behavior-gating.test.ts` pins the parity with the Chrome lanes (filters, file lists, retry, matrix), that only the release's `attach-assets` and `status` wait on a Firefox job, the `chrome` default of the shared `browser` input, and that the two browser caches share no key prefix; `decide-gate.test.ts` executes the draft rule. The network lane's promotion on `main` is staged (CLAUDE.md § Staged-rollout switches). How the suite drives Firefox and what differs: [`apps/extension/tests/e2e/FIREFOX.md`](./apps/extension/tests/e2e/FIREFOX.md).

### Check names and the protection runbook

Every aggregator check is named after the product it gates — `quality-status` (repo-wide), `extension-smoke-e2e-status`, `extension-network-e2e-status`, and the Firefox twins (required on `dev`) `extension-smoke-e2e-firefox-status` / `extension-network-e2e-firefox-status`. Branch protection matches those names literally, so a rename is a two-step owner action per branch, scripted in `scripts/ci-cd/required-checks.sh`: `print --branch <b> --json > <file>` (read-only; review the file), then `--apply --branch <b> --expect <file>` right before merging the rename (it refuses if the live protection drifted since the review, touches only `required_status_checks`, keeps `strict` and unrelated checks, verifies the write and prints the rollback). `--add a,b` appends new required checks the same way. `scripts/ci-cd/behavior-gating.test.ts` pins each PR workflow's aggregator name. The legacy labels `e2e:smoke` / `e2e:network` are still honored alongside `e2e:extension-smoke` / `e2e:extension-network` until the next stable cut.

### Concurrency

Each PR workflow groups its runs by pull request number, and only a push's first attempt cancels the run in flight: a push is the one event that moves the head. Every other PR event (a label, `ready_for_review`, `reopened`) and every re-run of a PR event queues behind the run in flight and starts when it ends. A `workflow_dispatch` run still cancels the one before it on its ref. A run cancelled on the head it shares with its successor still runs its `always()` aggregator, which then posts FAILURE under the required check name on that head, beside the surviving run's result; a run replaced while it waits in the queue posts nothing.

Every run evaluates its whole gate, whichever label started it. Do not skip a run whose label is irrelevant: its aggregator would report `skipped`, which branch protection accepts, and could green the required check before any run of that head had run its suites. The price is a second full run when a label lands, or a draft is marked ready, while a run is in flight (per browser, eight suite jobs on a PR that trips the network filter and three more when it trips the smoke one).

### `actionlint.yml`

Runs when any `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**`, or shell script changes. Lints the workflow YAML and shellchecks the scripts. Cheap; gate. Its `Status` (not required) is exact like `quality-status`: a linter whose filter tripped must succeed, one whose filter did not must be skipped.

### `release.yml`

Two triggers in one workflow:

- **`push` to `main`** — runs `googleapis/release-please-action` (v5, SHA-pinned). release-please scans Conventional Commits since the last tag and opens or updates a Release PR titled `chore: release X.Y.Z`. The PR bumps `package.json` + appends to `CHANGELOG.md` + updates `.release-please-manifest.json`. The PR's commits are app-authenticated (verified) via `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` using the `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_ID` + `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets. When the Release PR is merged, the next push-to-main run *should* see `release_created=true` and continue — but the v4 abort bug means it usually doesn't (release-please logs "untagged, merged release PRs outstanding" and leaves `release_created` false). The **`auto-unstick`** job handles that: when `release_created != 'true'` on a `push`, it detects the merged `autorelease: pending` Release PR at `github.sha`, creates the tag + empty release + relabels, and feeds `resolve` (`unstuck=true` + the tag) so the chain continues in the same run. It's gated by `vars.AUTO_UNSTICK_ENABLED` (in-code default **off**; the variable is `on`, so releases self-unstick — with it off the job no-ops and the manual unstick in [CLAUDE.md § Release runbook](./CLAUDE.md#release-runbook) is the fallback). Once a release is unstuck (auto or manual), the same workflow continues: gates → build chrome + firefox → smoke against the zipped artifact → `attach-assets` (zip + SHASUMS + `gh release upload --clobber` + `gh release edit --notes-file` with git-cliff body) → the store uploads (opt-in inputs, see below). The landing is not part of the chain: the `nulo-landing` Worker is redeployed by Workers Builds on pushes to `main`, so it shows a release after the next push or a dashboard re-run of its production build. A stable push also runs **`sync-main-to-dev`** (advisory, push-only): it opens the `chore: sync main → dev` PR that carries the release bump + `CHANGELOG` back into `dev` and re-baselines the prerelease manifest — clean PRs await your merge commit (`gh pr merge <n> --merge`, never squash: `dev` must keep `main`'s release commit in its ancestry for the prerelease version anchor), conflicts are labeled `needs-manual-resolution` (see [CLAUDE.md § After a stable cut](./CLAUDE.md#after-a-stable-cut-promotes-to-main)).

- **`workflow_dispatch`** — re-publish artifacts for an existing tag. Takes `tag` (e.g. `vX.Y.Z`), `dry_run` (default false), `run_network_e2e` (default false), `publish_chrome` and `publish_firefox` (both default false). Skips `release-please`; runs `resolve` → gates → build → smoke → `attach-assets`. Useful when an asset upload failed mid-publish.

`attach-assets` runs only when every gate it waits on succeeded, the network suite ended exactly as `run_network_e2e` asked, and the run was not cancelled. The `status` job checks every stage against its own condition and the control outputs those conditions read (`release_created`, `unstuck`, `is_prerelease`, `on_main`), so a stage that never ran, or a requested store upload that silently skipped, reds the release run.

**Store uploads** are opt-in `workflow_dispatch` inputs, never automatic: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f tag=vX.Y.Z -f publish_chrome=true`. Both publish jobs gate on `always() && !cancelled()`, the input, `resolve` + `attach-assets` success, `is_prerelease == 'false'` and `resolve`'s `on_main` output (the tag's commit is an ancestor of `origin/main`: `--ref` authenticates the workflow file, not the tag it checks out). `publish-chrome-store` is **keyless**: `environment: chrome-web-store` (variables `CWS_WIF_PROVIDER`, `CWS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, `CWS_PUBLISHER_ID`, `CWS_ITEM_ID`, `CWS_PUBLISH_TYPE`; no secret), `permissions: id-token: write`, `google-github-actions/auth` exchanges the job's OIDC token through Google Workload Identity Federation for a ten-minute access token on the service account linked in the Chrome Web Store dashboard, and `scripts/release/publish-chrome-store-run.ts` verifies the zip's checksum line, preflights `fetchStatus`, uploads, polls if the upload is async and publishes with `blockOnWarnings: true`. When the store refuses on warnings whose every `reason` is on the script's accepted list (`ACCEPTED_WARNINGS` in `publish-chrome-store.ts`: `BROAD_HOST_USAGE`, raised by the content script matching every page), it records the decision in the job summary and as a workflow warning, then retries once with `blockOnWarnings: false`; any other warning, an unreadable refusal, or a retry whose response lists a warning outside the list fails the job (the submission then exists, for the owner to review or cancel in the dashboard — the script never cancels one). Growing the list is a reviewed code change, not a variable, and `apps/extension/src/manifest.test.ts` pins the host permissions, the content-script matches and the absence of optional grants so nothing widens behind the accepted warning. A `dry_run=true` dispatch verifies the zip and prints the plan without authenticating. `publish-firefox-amo` runs in `environment: firefox-add-ons` with `contents: read` only; the Mozilla API key pair (`AMO_JWT_ISSUER`, `AMO_JWT_SECRET`) reaches exactly one step, after every third-party action has run. `scripts/release/publish-firefox-amo-run.ts` verifies the Firefox zip's checksum line, refuses a Chrome zip, a foreign `gecko.id` or a data declaration other than the settled `["financialAndPaymentInfo"]`, requires the `git archive` source package (prefixed `nulo-<v>/`, with `SOURCE-BUILD.md` and `bun.lock`, under 200 MB) and the reviewer-notes block of `apps/extension/store/listing.md`, then uploads on the listed channel, polls AMO's validation (five-minute deadline; `valid: false` prints the errors and creates nothing), creates the version with those notes and attaches the source. Every request carries a fresh 60-second HS256 JWT, masked. A failure after the version exists prints the recovery procedure (never re-run; attach the source by hand or re-send the `PATCH`). **`store-check.yml`** (`workflow_dispatch`, input `store` = `chrome` | `firefox` | `both`) proves a store credential read-only — Chrome: one `fetchStatus`; Firefox: the author-scoped add-on list must contain `wallet@nulo.sh` — in the store's environment, no upload, and is deliberately not an input of `release.yml`, whose non-dry dispatch re-uploads assets. Reproducibility of the Firefox source package is checked by `source-rebuild.yml` (weekly, or `-f tag=vX.Y.Z`): `git archive` rebuilt on x86_64 and Ubuntu ARM64 must be byte-identical to the shipped zip.

Config files: `.github/release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`. The git-cliff template at `cliff.toml` provides the final release-body content.

### `nightly.yml`

The repo's only nightly workflow (`source-rebuild.yml` runs weekly): every night it builds current `dev` and publishes a **prerelease** GitHub Release (`v<version>-nightly.<YYDDD>`) with the chrome + firefox zips + SHASUMS256.txt, so people can install the latest state of dev without a maintainer hand-off. Nightlies are marked pre-release and never take the "Latest" badge from stable releases. Also dispatchable manually (`force` bypasses the quiet-day skip; `dry_run` runs all gates but skips the publish).

- **Version scheme**: `<dev package.json version>-nightly.<YY+day-of-year>`. Chrome/Firefox cap each manifest version component at 65535 and `manifest.config.ts` strips non-numerics, so a calendar date would overflow — YYDDD keeps every component valid while `version_name` shows the full string. Same-day re-runs advance the day code by one instead of appending `.1` (a fifth component is an invalid manifest).
- **Gates are hard**: lint+typecheck → unit → full network suite (same shape as the PR gate: 5 proverless shards + 2 heavy jobs + real-proving canary) → chrome+firefox builds with the nightly version override → smoke against the built artifact. The tag + release are created only after everything is green, so a red night publishes nothing.
- **Flake policy** differs deliberately from the PR gate: the network suite runs at its config-default retry 2 (the PR gate forces 0 for honesty) plus the built-in infra-boot retry. A nightly absorbs flakes; a PR must surface them.
- **Quiet-day skip**: if the newest `v*-nightly.*` tag already points at dev HEAD, the run no-ops green.
- **Stable notes are protected**: `release.yml` passes `--ignore-tags '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+-nightly'` to git-cliff so nightly tags never act as range boundaries for a stable release's notes (without it, a stable cut the day after any nightly would only document the last ~24h). The nightly's own notes intentionally use the previous nightly as their boundary — a daily delta.
- **Interrupted-publish recovery**: `gh release create` makes the tag before assets finish uploading; a cancelled run can leave partial assets, and the quiet-day skip will then match that sha. Re-dispatch with `force=true` (publishes under a fresh date-code tag) or heal in place: rebuild the zips locally and `gh release upload <tag> …--clobber`.
- Schedules fire from the workflow file on the default branch (`dev`) — the trigger is inert on feature branches until merged.

### `publish-packages.yml`

Manual only (`version`, `dry_run` default true; refuses any ref but `dev`/`main`). Publishes `@nulo-sh/wallet-crypto`, `@nulo-sh/resolve-asset` and `@nulo-sh/wallet-sdk-schema-patch` at one lockstep version through npm trusted publishing — no npm token exists. Four jobs. `test` runs `test:release` (it executes `@aztec-labs/*` code, so it makes no bytes). `pack`, in parallel, makes the bytes and runs no test code: `oven-sh/setup-bun` with its cache off and a fresh `BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR`, `bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts` (a shared Actions cache is writable by any dev- or main-scoped job, so none is restored), `scripts/publish/stage.ts --all` → `npm pack` of every staged directory → `check-digests.ts` (the first publication, `0.1.0`, must match `scripts/publish/approved-digests.json`) → the tarballs as an artifact, with their sha256 and integrity in the step summary. `publish` needs both, is the only job with `id-token: write`, runs in the `npm-publish` environment (owner approval) and runs no repository code: it checks the tarball set against the three names, re-checks the digests on the downloaded bytes, refuses any version but `0.1.0` until `0.1.0` is on npm, skips a version already published with identical bytes, and runs `npm publish --provenance`. `verify` then waits, for up to 15 minutes, until the registry's document lists every version and every tarball URL answers 200 (a fresh version can take minutes to reach the registry's CDN), and runs `scripts/publish/verify-provenance.sh` on each tarball (`gh attestation verify` against the registry's SLSA bundle: signed by this workflow on `dev` or `main`, naming these bytes) and `npm audit signatures`, which also covers a skipped re-run. `publish` and `verify` download `pack`'s artifact by ID and check each tarball against the sha256 list `pack` outputs, because `test` holds the same artifact token and could replace a named artifact. Node is pinned exactly because the digests depend on its npm and zlib. `scripts/ci-cd/publish-packages.test.ts` pins that shape; [`scripts/publish/README.md`](./scripts/publish/README.md) has the one-time trusted-publisher bootstrap.

## Labels

| Label | Effect |
|---|---|
| `e2e:extension-smoke` | Force-run smoke e2e on this PR — Chrome and (unless the PR is a draft) Firefox. |
| `e2e:extension-network` | Force-run network e2e on this PR — Chrome and (unless the PR is a draft) Firefox. |

Adding the label triggers a fresh run; removing it re-evaluates the gate (so a stale failing check goes green if the filter doesn't trip).

## Local equivalents

Everything CI runs has a local equivalent:

| CI gate | Local command |
|---|---|
| lint | `bun run lint` |
| typecheck | `bun run typecheck:all` |
| unit tests | `bun run test:all` |
| build (chrome) | `bun run --cwd apps/extension build:chrome` |
| build (firefox) | `bun run --cwd apps/extension build:firefox` |
| smoke e2e | `bun run --cwd apps/extension test:e2e` |
| network e2e | `bun run e2e:agent` (NOTE: local runs do NOT use `presto-server`. The wallet's `PrestoProver` probes the **Presto** desktop app over HTTPS on `127.0.0.1:59834` and uses it if available; otherwise WASM. CI specifically stamps `VITE_NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED=1` to enforce no-fallback — that's not set locally.) |
| one-shot pre-PR | `bun run audit:vue` (typecheck + units + lint + build) |

## Releasing

Releases are driven by `release-please`. The human touchpoint is a single click — merging the Release PR.

1. Confirm what you want to ship is on `main` (via the usual `release: promote dev → main` PR).
2. Wait for `release.yml` to run on the push to main. It opens (or updates) a Release PR titled `chore: release X.Y.Z`. The version comes from Conventional Commits since the last tag.
3. Review the Release PR. CI runs the normal `quality-status` check. Eyeball the proposed `CHANGELOG.md` diff + `package.json` bumps.
4. Merge the Release PR via the GitHub UI (merge commit).
5. The next push-to-main run of `release.yml` sees the release was created. The same workflow run continues: gates → build chrome + firefox → smoke → `attach-assets` (uploads zips + SHASUMS, overlays git-cliff release notes onto the GitHub Release body).

Tag format is `v<X.Y.Z>` (forced by `include-v-in-tag: true` + `include-component-in-tag: false` in `.github/release-please-config.json`). Prerelease (rc) support **exists** — `v<X.Y.Z>-rc.<N>` cut from `dev` via [`release-prerelease.yml`](./.github/workflows/release-prerelease.yml); see [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) § Release runbook (Prerelease).

### Forcing the next-version

release-please picks the next version from Conventional Commit types: `feat:` → minor, `fix:` → patch, `BREAKING CHANGE:` (in the body or footer) → major. To force a specific version mid-flight, add a `Release-As: X.Y.Z` footer to any commit on `main`.

### Re-publishing assets for an existing tag

If a release was tagged but the asset upload failed (e.g. transient `gh release upload` error), use the `workflow_dispatch` escape hatch:

1. GitHub Actions tab → `release.yml` → "Run workflow".
2. Fill in:
   - `tag` — e.g. `vX.Y.Z`. Required.
   - `dry_run` — leave **false** to actually upload; `true` previews without changing the release.
   - `run_network_e2e` — leave **true** in most cases. Disable only for emergency re-publishes where the network gate is known-good.
   - `publish_chrome` / `publish_firefox` — leave **false** unless this republish is the store submission; each runs in its protected environment and only for a stable tag on `main`.
3. The workflow skips `release-please`, fetches the tag, and re-runs gates → build → smoke → `attach-assets`.

## Debugging a failing PR

1. Click the failing check in the PR conversation. The `status` aggregator job's first error line points at the underlying job.
2. Open the underlying job's log. Failures are surfaced via `::error::` annotations and tend to surface as a single line.
3. Match against the workflow source (`.github/workflows/...`) to confirm what step ran.
4. Re-run the failing job from the GitHub UI ("Re-run failed jobs") if you suspect a transient flake.

For smoke / network e2e specifically: failure artifacts (vitest output, `.e2e-state/`, sandbox logs) upload on failure. Download them from the run page's "Artifacts" section.

## CI gating — derived from the dependency graph

The `pr-quick` / `pr-extension-smoke-e2e` / `pr-extension-network-e2e` `changes` jobs use `dorny/paths-filter` to skip work on PRs that can't affect a given target. **These filters are derived from the workspace dependency graph, not hand-curated** — a suite/build runs whenever any package its target is built from changes:

- **Built targets** (`extension`, `landing`, `playground`) → gated on the **whole package** (`apps/<target>/**`), so no build input (manifest, vite/tsconfig configs, `public/` assets, scripts, the e2e harness) can ever be silently missed.
- **Dependency libraries** (`wallet-core`, `wallet-crypto`, `extension-messaging`, `aztec-runtime`, `wallet-bridge`, `design`) → gated on their consumed surface (`packages/<dep>/src/**` + `package.json`); their own README/docs stay out of the gate.
- Plus repo-wide build inputs (`package.json`, `bun.lock`, `bunfig.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, **`patches/**`**) + each suite's harness/workflow files.

**Two hard rules:**

1. **Never use a bare `!` negation pattern.** `dorny/paths-filter` defaults to `predicate-quantifier: some` (a file matches a filter if it matches ANY pattern), so a bare `!packages/x/**/*.md` matches *every file that isn't that md* → the filter silently becomes `**` and fires on every PR. Exclude by listing positive paths only (or, for true subset-exclusion, picomatch extglobs — never a bare `!`).
2. **Gate on the graph.** When the extension or the landing gains a new `@nulo/*` dependency, add it to the relevant filters. [`scripts/ci-cd/behavior-gating.test.ts`](./scripts/ci-cd/behavior-gating.test.ts) recomputes each target's transitive graph from `package.json` and **fails CI** (via the `test:ci-gating` step in `_unit-tests.yml`) if a gate doesn't cover it, or if a `!` negation reappears — so the lists can't silently rot. The gates intentionally **over-trigger** (a colocated `*.test.ts`/`*.stories.ts` edit under `src/` runs the e2e suites) — the safe direction: err toward running, never skipping.

Design record: [`implementations-plan/archive/paths-filter-negation-fix/`](./implementations-plan/archive/paths-filter-negation-fix/plan.md).

## Adding a new gate

1. If the gate is a single shell step, add it to an existing workflow's job.
2. If the gate is a whole job with its own runner / timeout / failure-artifact policy, create a reusable workflow at `.github/workflows/_<gate-name>.yml` and call it from the relevant top-level workflow(s).
3. Add it to the `status` aggregator's `needs:` and check its result there against the state its `if:` asks for (`success` when it runs, `skipped` when it does not); [`scripts/ci-cd/aggregators.test.ts`](./scripts/ci-cd/aggregators.test.ts) and `behavior-gating.test.ts` fail on a need the aggregator never checks.
4. Update this file's "What runs when" matrix.

The reusables today are:
- `_lint-and-typecheck.yml` — biome + typecheck
- `_unit-tests.yml` — vitest workspace-wide
- `_build-extension.yml` — chrome + firefox (with optional version override)
- `_extension-smoke-e2e.yml` — puppeteer smoke against `EXTENSION_PATH` or downloaded artifact
- `_extension-network-e2e.yml` — Aztec sandbox + agent runner

Composite actions (step-level reuse):
- `setup-bun` — checkout + bun + lockfile cache + `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
- `setup-aztec` — Foundry + Aztec CLI matching the declared version, cached; the installer script, its `versions` manifest and the noir tarball are SHA-256-pinned (`installer-pins.sha256`)
- `setup-puppeteer` — `~/.cache/puppeteer` cache

## Known limitations

- **Extension smoke e2e is required on both `dev` and `main`** (as `extension-smoke-e2e-status`). Its fixtures can still flake (cross-file Chrome teardown — see [`implementations-plan/archive/ci-cd/plan.md`](./implementations-plan/archive/ci-cd/plan.md#smoke-gating)); treat a red smoke like any gate — flake → re-run, breakage → fix — never neutralize it.
- **Extension network e2e quarantines nothing.** Every skip in `tests/e2e/network/` is a `skipIf` on the test's own precondition, such as an Aztec config, a local network or a behaviour only one browser has (`CHROME_ONLY` and `FIREFOX_ONLY` in `apps/extension/tests/e2e/fixtures/browser/index.ts` carry each browser reason). Open flake fingerprints live in the `e2e-testing` skill's flake ledger.
- **Store publishing**: both jobs need their GitHub environments (`chrome-web-store`, `firefox-add-ons`: reviewer = owner, `main` only) and an existing item on each store (see § `release.yml`). Nulo V6 reuses both items, renamed. The Firefox `gecko.id`, `wallet@nulo.sh`, is final.
