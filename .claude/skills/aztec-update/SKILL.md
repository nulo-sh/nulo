name: aztec-update
description: Runbook for bumping the Aztec version line, @aztec-labs/* and @aztec-foundation/* (rc bumps, protocol forks, testnet resets). Use when the user asks to update/bump Aztec, aztec.js, the Aztec packages, or to move to a new rc/release — or runs /aztec-update. Covers the full pin surface, drift detection, the execution canaries, and the wallet side of a testnet reset (the bridge's generation redeploy belongs to alejoamiras/unleashed).

# Aztec version update

Operational runbook distilled from the shipped bumps (4.2→5.0 hard fork: `implementations-plan/archive/aztec-5.0-upgrade/`; rc.1→rc.2 + testnet redeploy: `implementations-plan/archive/aztec-5.0-rc2/`; rc.2→5.0.0 stable + reset under intent tooling: `implementations-plan/archive/aztec-5.0.0-stable/`; 5.2.0→6.0.0-rc.1, a scope move with a network reset and a new address regime: `implementations-plan/archive/nulo-v6/` — read those records for worked examples). Non-trivial bumps still go through `/blueprint` — this skill is the domain checklist the plan draws from, not a substitute for planning.

The bridge's half of a bump — the generation runbook, the Noir contract surface and the bridge drift detectors — lives with the bridge in [`alejoamiras/unleashed`](https://github.com/alejoamiras/unleashed).

> **This skill is the source of truth for the Aztec-bump process. Update it when the process changes** — a new pin surface, a new failure mode, a toolchain/proving shift. A durable lesson from a bump belongs HERE (not only in the plan's `lessons/`). CLAUDE.md's skill-routing table points here for that reason.

## Phase 0 — classify the bump (do this FIRST, it forks everything)

Two independent questions:

1. **Did the target network reset?** Probe the live node and compare against our pin. The Testnet
   seed's endpoint (`TESTNET_RPC_URL`) carries the provider key in its path, so read it from the
   file rather than printing it (or probe the target network's announced endpoint instead):
   ```bash
   url=$(rg -o 'https://[^"]+' apps/extension/src/wallet/constants/network-endpoints.ts)
   curl -s -X POST "$url" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"node_getNodeInfo","params":[]}' | jq '.result | {nodeVersion, rollupVersion}'
   rg -n 'TESTNET_ROLLUP_VERSION' apps/extension/src/utils/chain-ids.ts
   ```
   Different rollupVersion ⇒ **NETWORK RESET** ⇒ Branch B below (the wallet's side of the reset) is mandatory. The bridge's new generation on that network belongs to `alejoamiras/unleashed`.
2. **What changed upstream?** `@aztec-labs/*` is built from `aztec-labs-eng/aztec-node` (`gh api repos/aztec-labs-eng/aztec-node/compare/v<old>...v<new>`); `@aztec-foundation/bb.js`, the noir wasm pair and `l1-artifacts` still come from `AztecProtocol/aztec-packages` (the same compare there). Scan `!:` commits, then grep OUR surface for the broken symbols before assuming they bite. Expect class-id shifts from ANY toolchain/bytecode change even when no API we call moved.

**Then gate on the user via the `AskUserQuestion` tool** — present what the probes FOUND (rollupVersions, `!:` commit count, our-surface hits), never ask blind. **No implementation starts while ANY clarifying question is open**: Q1 below is the mandatory minimum, and anything else the probes left ambiguous — the exact target version, validation depth (network-e2e on both browsers?), whether the extension release timing matters — gets batched into the same `AskUserQuestion` call(s) up front. Silent assumptions are how a bump strands funds (Fee Juice paid to a wrong PrivateFPC address is unrecoverable). The fixed question:

- **Q1 "Bump class"** (single-select) — options grounded in the probe result, e.g.:
  - `Version-only bump` — rollupVersion unchanged; pins + detectors + canaries, the wallet's chain identity untouched (Branch A).
  - `Network reset — wallet-side cascade` — rollupVersion moved; the bump carries the wallet's chain-identity cascade and client-side reset (Branch B). Recommend whichever the probe supports and mark it "(Recommended)".
  - Note the third state: **rollupVersion unchanged but the Phase-1 drift detector fires anyway** (an upstream toolchain/derivation change moved the wallet's derived PrivateFPC address without a reset). It cannot be classified up front; when the detector goes red on a "version-only" run, STOP and re-gate through `AskUserQuestion` (hold the bump vs a conscious re-pin, which owes a review of the new artifact and unleashed's manifest naming the new address; see the drift detector below). *(This second re-gate is load-bearing: Q1 is answered BEFORE the Phase-1 detectors run, so the Phase-0 gate is sufficient only in combination with it — do not remove it.)*

Do not start Phase 1 before the answer. Mid-run surprises that change the shape of what was authorized (a forced storage migration, an unexpected re-pin) go back through `AskUserQuestion` — authorization for one scope doesn't extend to the next.

## Phase 1 — the bump (always)

**The pin surface** — miss one and you get a mixed old/new set:
- `@aztec-labs/*` and `@aztec-foundation/*` exact pins across the workspace package.json files (`rg '"@aztec-(labs|foundation)/' apps/*/package.json packages/*/package.json`). `@aztec/viem` is versioned independently — leave it.
- **`@alejoamiras/presto`** (extension + aztec-runtime) — it exact-depends on `@aztec-labs` transitives; skipping it silently reintroduces the old line. Bump it WITH the Aztec line: the page-side client sends the workspace `@aztec-labs/pxe` version and the offscreen prover sends the SDK's own pin, and a drift surfaces as the visible `version-mismatch` state.
- **`@aztec-foundation/aztec-standards` + `@alejoamiras/private-fee-juice`** (6 pins across `apps/extension`, `apps/playground`, `packages/aztec-runtime`) — they move with the line. The PrivateFPC artifact the wallet derives from ships in `private-fee-juice` (the drift detector below), and `aztec-standards` fixes the Token class every default seed and user-added standards token runs (`default-tokens.test.ts` pins the two together). Holding either is its own decision: list it in `HELD_ROOTS` in `scripts/aztec-hold-residue-check.ts`, which otherwise enforces one generation.
- **Four version readers keyed by package name**: `.github/actions/setup-aztec/action.yml`, `apps/extension/scripts/e2e/docker-ci-like.sh` and `apps/extension/tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` read the `@aztec-labs/aztec.js` pin to pick the toolchain, and `apps/extension/vite.shared.ts` reads `@aztec-labs/pxe` into `__AZTEC_VERSION__` (Presto's version handshake, the About page, the backup envelope's `aztec-version`), throwing on a missing key. A package or scope rename moves all four.
- **CI's installer pins** (`.github/actions/setup-aztec/installer-pins.sha256`): SHA-256 of the per-version installer (`https://install.aztec-labs.com/<pin>/install`), of the `versions` manifest beside it, and of the noir release tarball (`noir-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`) that manifest's `noir:` line names. `setup-aztec` hashes each before use and refuses a version with no pin, so a bump that skips them fails every cold network-e2e job at setup. A pin certifies the bytes you read: diff the new installer against the pinned one, and confirm it still reads `INSTALL_URI`, `NARGO` and npm's environment config (the action feeds the verified manifest, the verified noir binaries and the release-age gate through them) and fetches nothing new. Then `sha256sum` both files, check the noir tarball's hash against its release asset's `digest` (`gh api repos/noir-lang/noir/releases/tags/v<noir>`), and replace the old lines in the bump commit.
- **Name-keyed sites tsc cannot see** — a rename misses them silently (the full list: `implementations-plan/archive/nulo-v6/plan.md#name-keyed-sites`): the bb.js fetch-code shim's importer match in `apps/extension/vite.config.ts`, `HEAVY_SCOPES` and `NEVER_GROUPED` in `apps/extension/scripts/vendor-chunks.ts` (the web-accessible wallet-sdk chunk), the scope prefixes in `store-listing.test.ts`, `presto-core-deps.test.ts`, `scripts/lockfile-exception-diff.ts` and `scripts/publish/stage.ts`, the `@nulo/resolve-asset` and `require.resolve` strings (`layout-identity.test.ts`, `packages/resolve-asset/src/index.test.ts`, `scripts/ci-cd/test-soak/lib.ts`), and the Vite `dedupe`, `optimizeDeps` and noir alias keys.
- **The third-party notices overrides** (`packages/third-party-notices/src/policy.ts`): the `@aztec-labs/*` packages ship neither a licence field nor a licence file, so each override is bound to a `reviewedVersion` and the extension build REFUSES the new line until it is re-verified. Re-check, at the new tags, `aztec-node`'s root LICENSE, `aztec-packages`' root and `barretenberg/` LICENSE files, the noir submodule commit (`gh api 'repos/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/contents/noir/noir-repo?ref=v<new>'`) and the sqlite3mc pin in `@aztec-labs/sqlite3mc-wasm`'s README (the wasm must stay byte-identical to the upstream release zip it names); refresh `texts/` only from those tagged sources, then bump `reviewedVersion` and the URLs. Procedure: that package's README, § When a build is refused.
- The two noir patches: rename `patches/@aztec-foundation%2Fnoir-{acvm_js,noirc_abi}@<v>.patch` + the `patchedDependencies` keys in the root package.json (Bun drops an unmatched key silently; the `"node":` marker checks in `layout-identity.test.ts` and `resolve-asset/src/index.test.ts` are the proof a patch applied).
- `bunfig.toml` `minimumReleaseAgeExcludes`: fresh publishes are min-age-blocked, and the gate bites TRANSITIVES too — enumerate every `@aztec-labs/*` and `@aztec-foundation/*` name from `bun.lock` (~30), plus `@alejoamiras/presto`, `@alejoamiras/private-fee-juice` and `@aztec-foundation/aztec-standards` when they move too. They are needed whenever `bun install` RESOLVES the new line: once `bun.lock` is final, delete them again in the same PR and prove it with `bun install --frozen-lockfile --force` (a frozen install never re-gates). For the following 7 days, any `package.json` edit in a workspace that reaches the new line (`apps/extension`, `packages/aztec-runtime`, …) re-gates it and fails the install — so land the bump's dependency changes in the bump PR, and for a stray later edit re-add the excludes locally without committing them. Keep a dated exclude across PRs only when a later PR of the same bump must re-resolve.

**The lockfile ritual** — `bun install` after editing the pins. Targeted re-resolution holds
transitives to the min-age gate (Bun ≥ 1.4), so a plain install is the default; `rm bun.lock` is
the last resort for unresolvable conflicts only (a full regen re-gates every already-locked
version and invites unrelated churn).
- ⚠️ `bunfig.toml` pins `linker = "isolated"` — do NOT change it. Asset lookups stay
  layout-agnostic through `@nulo/resolve-asset`;
  `apps/extension/scripts/layout-identity.test.ts` is the executable
  guarantee (and carries `expectVersion` literals that MUST move with the line).
- Diff the lock with `bun scripts/lockfile-exception-diff.ts <base-lock> bun.lock` and
  disposition every `exceptions/added/removed` entry (no blanket acceptance).
- **Residue is an ALLOWLIST check, not a zero check.** When any package is deliberately held,
  old-line entries legitimately remain. `bun scripts/aztec-hold-residue-check.ts` encodes it:
  graph-reachability from the held roots (bun.lock v2 shortens a single-dependent nested key to
  the bare position, so key-prefix matching gives false failures) plus `realpath` resolution
  from every consumer workspace. Anything else on the old line is a missed pin.
- Fresh publishes are min-age-blocked. Prefer waiting; when a first-party release must land
  immediately, add ONE `minimumReleaseAgeExcludes` entry, record the provenance you verified in the PR
  (registry signature + npm/SLSA attestation binding the tarball to a repo+commit), and delete
  the entry in the same PR once the lockfile is written.
- Provenance actually runs like this: build a scratch npm project from the exception-diff's
  resolved `name@version` set, `npm install --ignore-scripts`, THEN `npm audit signatures`.
  `--package-lock-only` makes audit a no-op ("found no dependencies to audit"), so a run made
  that way proves nothing.

**API churn**: `bun run typecheck:all` is the fast-fail — **but typecheck is NOT sufficient on a fork-class bump.** Surfaces typecheck can't see (5.0-fork precedent): copied/adapted upstream logic (fee options, gas math) that must be re-diffed against the new upstream; the `@nulo/wallet-sdk-schema-patch` package (it extends `WalletSchema` at runtime and throws if the wallet-sdk schema shape moved; its `apply.test.ts` and `packages/wallet-bridge/src/dispatcher.test.ts` under `test:all` exercise it, typecheck doesn't); and native-proving required-mode (`VITE_NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED`) surviving the proving-stack change. Port mechanically and behavior-preserving; wrap renamed upstream APIs inside our service layer so OUR RPC surfaces don't ripple (precedent: PXE senders → tagging-secret sources, wrapped in `PxeService`). Non-mechanical churn (a removed API we depend on) → stop, triage it with a second reviewer, re-plan.

**The frozen account surface (never bumped with the line)**: the account artifact is VENDORED
(`packages/aztec-runtime/src/account/artifacts/SchnorrAccount.json`) and, with the instantiation
descriptor + regime record (`frozen-artifact.ts`, `instantiation-descriptor.ts`,
`address-freeze.ts`), fixes every derived account address. A bump must leave the KAT
(`derivation-vectors.test.ts`) and all freeze tests green with ZERO vector regeneration and zero
pin edits — if a bump reds any of them, upstream moved a protocol-level input; STOP, that is
new-extension-major territory, not a re-pin (mirror the PrivateFPC conscious-re-pin spirit; see
CLAUDE.md "Account-address freeze").

**The scope guard's coverage.** `PxeService` refuses to sync a scope the PXE holds no keys for,
because the HandshakeRegistry sync would move that account's cursor past its handshakes for good
(`packages/aztec-runtime/src/pxe/handshake-delivery.sources.test.ts` pins the three upstream
behaviours behind it). The guard sits in the six methods that reach `ensureContractSynced` today; on
every bump, grep the new `@aztec-labs/pxe` `dest/` for `ensureContractSynced(` callers and confirm
each is still reached only through `getNotes`, `simulateTx`, `proveTx`, `profileTx`,
`executeUtility` or `getPrivateEvents` (`scope-registration.test.ts`). A new entry point needs the
guard before the bump ships.

**The drift detector** (GREEN on every bump, reset or not — the address is network-independent):
`apps/extension/src/wallet/services/fpc/protocol-fpcs.test.ts` re-derives the PrivateFPC through
the wallet's own `derivePrivateFpc()` (`protocol-fpcs.ts`: the `private-fee-juice` artifact, salt
`0x…01`, deployer zero) and pins salt, deployer and address to the canonical deployment. The same
file pins the artifact's reviewed digest (function flags such as `isStatic` sit outside the class id,
yet the wallet copies them into the calls it builds) and that the package's runtime copy
(`dist/target/`, what fixtures and dApps register) equals the one the wallet derives from — so any
`private-fee-juice` move reds it: review the new artifact, then re-pin the digest. Red means
the artifact, the salt or upstream's derivation moved, and the wallet would pay Fee Juice to an
address the bridge does not fund — an UNRECOVERABLE loss. Default response: HOLD the bump. Re-pinning
the literals is a CONSCIOUS act: review the new artifact, re-pin, and hand the address to
`alejoamiras/unleashed`, whose bridge credits Fee Juice to it; a release may ship only once
unleashed's manifest names the address the wallet pins. The canonical PrivateFPC is
initializerless and private-only, so nothing is ever deployed at it: the seed preflight answers
`NOT FOUND` for it on every network, and that is its normal state, not a missing deploy. Never
silence the test. The other tripwires: the account KAT and freeze tests (above); `apps/extension/src/wallet/services/token/default-tokens.test.ts`
(the bundled aztec-standards Token class equals every seed's live class — red means a standards move
would strand every deployed token, so HOLD aztec-standards; the seeds are what the chain serves and
are never re-pinned to match); `scripts/aztec-hold-residue-check.ts` (the lockfile ritual) and
`descriptors-real-artifact.test.ts` (Gotchas).

**The two execution canaries (MANDATORY, every Aztec bump PR)**: run
`bun run e2e:agent tests/e2e/network/frozen-account-canary.test.ts tests/e2e/network/passkey-execution-canary.test.ts`
**prover-ON** before merge, **on Chrome and again under `NULO_E2E_BROWSER=firefox`** (geckodriver on
PATH; `apps/extension/tests/e2e/FIREFOX.md`). First `aztec-up install <new @aztec-labs/aztec.js pin>`: the
sandbox boots only from the complete pinned toolchain under `$AZTEC_HOME/versions/<pin>` (CLI,
`aztec-anvil`, `internal-bin/{forge,anvil}`; `AZTEC_HOME` defaults to `~/.aztec`), and `e2e:agent`
fails closed without it. On a machine other agents share, install into a private home
(`AZTEC_HOME=<dir> aztec-up install <pin>`) and run with the same `AZTEC_HOME`: the installer
re-points the shared `~/.aztec/current`, and foundryup refuses to install beside a running anvil. LOCALLY, `e2e:agent` has NO Presto enforcement — it silently falls back to in-browser WASM if
no prover is up, which would pass the canary WITHOUT proving anything about native proving. To
actually run it prover-ON locally: start `PRESTO_ALLOW_ALL=1 presto-server` on `127.0.0.1:59833` (the
SHA-pinned binary from `_extension-network-e2e.yml`; the variable is scoped to that one process and
auto-approves the wallet's origin), build the wallet with `VITE_NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED=1`, and confirm at
least one `Proving succeeded` in the presto log during the run (`Received /prove request` is logged
before authorization, so a denied request prints it too). In CI this is
automatic: both canaries are named files in the prover-ON `network-e2e-canary` job of **both** network
lanes — `pr-extension-network-e2e.yml`, enforced by the required `extension-network-e2e-status` check, and
`pr-extension-network-e2e-firefox.yml`, advisory as a check — and each lane's `Assert canary results` step
reads the run's json report back against `scripts/ci-cd/canary-expectations.json`, so a canary that
skipped, vanished or never ran reds the job. That is the authoritative gate; the local run is a
pre-flight. The frozen canary proves the regime's frozen account bytecode still simulates, proves natively,
and is accepted by the bumped node/toolchain across the full arc (frozen-ctor multicall deploy →
init-nullifier flip → authwit consume → background-restart re-derive + tx); the passkey canary proves
the same for a PRF-derived account (in-page ceremony → frozen ctor → authwit consume →
background-restart ceremony re-unlock + tx). The address KAT cannot see execution breakage — these
canaries are the only gate that does. **A red canary on either browser BLOCKS the bump** (read the
Firefox lane's canary job on the bump PR by hand — advisory means it cannot block a merge, not that it
may be ignored): default response is HOLD the Aztec line; shipping a new extension major
(address-regime rotation) is the deliberate alternative — never a casual fix.

## Branch A — bump-only (no reset, detectors green)

Normal delivery: `test:all` + `lint` + the builds (`bun run build:chrome`, `bun run build:firefox`, `bun run --cwd apps/playground build`, `bun run --cwd apps/landing build`) + **both prover-ON execution canaries (above)** → PR labeled **`e2e:extension-network` + `e2e:extension-smoke`** (forces both suites — the dep diff warrants it) → all three required checks green → merge. Done.

## Branch B — network reset (the wallet side)

A reset moves the wallet's chain identity and wipes everything deployed on the old rollup. The bridge-side work it forces — a new bridge generation, whose manifest must name the wallet's PrivateFPC, and the live bridge canaries — belongs to `alejoamiras/unleashed`. The wallet's share:

1. **ChainId cascade** — the wallet chainId is `walletChainId(l1ChainId, rollupVersion) = (l1 ^ rollupVersion) >>> 0` (`apps/extension/src/utils/chain-ids.ts`: bump `TESTNET_ROLLUP_VERSION`; `CHAIN_IDS`/`DEFAULT_SEEDS` derive from it) + `chain-ids.test.ts`. `rg` the old rollupVersion AND the old wallet chainId repo-wide — comments, test fixtures and `apps/extension/scripts/seed-preflight.ts` carry the literal — and classify every hit.
2. **Client-side reset**: the storage baseline is `BASELINE_VERSION` in `apps/extension/src/wallet/storage/migrations/index.ts` — pre-production, a fresh reinstall stamps it and runs nothing, and a shape change just redefines the baseline (no client migration UX). Chain-coupled rows (tokens, txs, balances, and other per-deployment state) are purged per-chain by `NetworkService.purgeChain` → each service's `clearChainState` (the `registerChainPurgeSubscriber` cascade + `PxeServiceClient.clearChainState`), fired when the stale network is removed. User-authored roots (contacts) are NOT chain-coupled and persist.
3. **Default-token seeds** — `apps/extension/src/wallet/services/token/default-tokens.ts` and `apps/extension/src/wallet/services/price/price-map.ts` key their testnet entries by `CHAIN_IDS.TESTNET`, so the cascade re-keys them onto the new chain while their contracts stayed on the old one. Every testnet seed mirrors an L2 token unleashed's testnet generation pre-creates (`bridge.tokens[].l2Token` in unleashed's `apps/tools/public/testnet-bridge.json`, read as data), and their addresses live once, in `TESTNET_TOKENS` in `default-tokens.ts`, which the price map prices from. When a reset or a new generation moves them, re-point every entry there, then re-run both preflights against the new node for every testnet seed (from `apps/extension`: `bun run scripts/seed-preflight.ts <address> <expectedClassId>` and `bun run scripts/seed-preflight-metadata.ts <address>`): the class, symbol and decimals they print are the pins the seeder enforces (`expectedClassId`, `expectedSymbol`, `expectedDecimals`), the name is the label a row shows before the chain answers (`displayName`, never compared), and `default-tokens.test.ts` holds the class to the bundled Standards Token class. A token the manifest adds or drops, a re-pin or a replaced seed changes what a fresh wallet shows, and a priced row what it is worth: an owner UI decision (CLAUDE.md § UI changes need explicit owner sign-off), never a runbook default.
4. **PrivateFPC** — its canonical address is network-independent, so nothing here moves unless the drift detector fires, and nothing is redeployed: the contract is initializerless and private-only, so the preflight answers `NOT FOUND` for it on every network, which is its normal state. What a release that targets the new network checks is that unleashed's manifest for its new generation names the address `protocol-fpcs.test.ts` pins; a different address means the bridge credits Fee Juice the wallet never spends.

Then Branch A's delivery gates.

## Gotchas (hard-won)

- **Sweep version literals across the WHOLE workspace, not just the app.** Test fixtures pin the
  expected Aztec version in places a per-app grep misses — `apps/extension/scripts/
  layout-identity.test.ts` AND `packages/resolve-asset/src/index.test.ts` both hardcode it, and
  the second one only surfaced in CI. Run `rg -l '<old-version>' --glob '!node_modules'
  --glob '!bun.lock'` from the repo root and classify every hit.
- **`test:all` passes only when its EXIT CODE is 0.** Counting `Exited with code 0` lines is not
  a pass signal — failing packages hide behind passing ones. Check `rc=$?` and grep for
  `Exited with code [1-9]`/`FAIL ` explicitly.

- **One Aztec generation in the bundle, always.** Upstream's `getVKIndex`
  (`noir-protocol-circuits-types/artifacts/vks/tree.ts`) discriminates with `instanceof`, so two
  copies of that module make it treat the VK object as its own hash and abort with
  `VK index for [object Object] not found in VK tree` — thrown in-wallet BEFORE any `/prove`
  request, so the presto log is silent and it looks like a proving failure that never
  reached the prover. Any package that exact-pins its own Aztec deps (the Presto SDK)
  must move WITH the line; holding it is not an option. Packages that declare exact-version
  PEERS (private-fee-juice) or nothing at all (standards) re-bind to the workspace line and are
  safe to hold. Gate: `scripts/aztec-hold-residue-check.ts`.
- **Upstream recompiles `@aztec-labs/accounts` artifacts on toolchain changes** (5.2.0 moved
  SchnorrAccount's class id, −3,892 bytes). Production is immune — addresses come from the
  vendored frozen artifact — but any E2E fixture that builds accounts through
  `EmbeddedWallet.createSchnorrAccount` will fund one address and deploy another. Fix at the
  wallet-construction seam: `EmbeddedWallet`'s constructor takes an `AccountContractsProvider`,
  so subclass it and serve the frozen artifact for schnorr (see `FrozenArtifactWallet` in
  `apps/extension/tests/e2e/fixtures/aztec.ts`). Symptom order if you patch it piecemeal:
  address-parity mismatch → `Public keys not registered for account` → `Account "0x…" does not
  exist on this wallet` — those are three different upstream steps you'd be re-implementing;
  don't, use the provider.
- **`tests/e2e` is outside the tsconfig graph** — fixture breakage never shows in
  `typecheck:all`. The network suite is the only detector. 6.0.0-rc.1's `.simulate()` answers
  `{ result, … }`, not the bare value, so a guard that compares the raw answer (`balance === 0n`)
  never fires and no gate shows its TS2367: unwrap `.result`.
- **Clear `<app>/node_modules/.vite` after a dependency-line swap**, before the first e2e run.
  Stale dep-optimizer caches make dev-served apps fail with `.vite/deps/*.js does not exist`,
  which surfaces as a page that never loads and a test that times out far from the cause.
- **Don't edit fixtures while a suite is running.** Vitest workers load them per-worker, so a
  mid-run edit yields a mix of old and new code and results you must throw away.
- **Match the local run to CI's topology.** CI runs the network pool proverless in shards and
  only a 3-file canary lane prover-ON. Running all ~70 files prover-ON locally is ~2.5h for no
  extra signal; run prover-ON for the canaries + fee/tx-send paths and proverless for the rest.
  Two files carry `@requires-proverless` and the runner hard-fails if they're in a prover-ON set.
  And SHARD the proverless pass locally — `agent.sh` allocates its own ports per run, so 3-4
  concurrent shards are safe (CI runs 5) and cut it from ~25min to under 10. Prover-ON is the
  exception: every shard would queue on the single presto-server at the hardcoded port 59833.
- **`BB_BINARY_PATH` is a footgun**: Presto's `find_bb` honours the seed before the versioned
  cache, so a version-mismatched seed proves everything with the wrong bb while the log shows a
  download of the right one. Run the server unseeded.

- rc.2+ `DeployMethod.send()` returns `Promise<DeployResultMined>` (no `.deployed()` chain), and codegen'd `Contract.deploy` needs the **EmbeddedWallet itself** as the `Wallet` (the account object lacks `getContractClassMetadata`) with the account as `from`.
- A CONFLICTING PR runs **zero CI silently** (GitHub can't build the merge ref) — check `mergeable` before wondering where the checks went.
- `FeeJuice.claim_and_end_setup` is ONLY valid as the fee payload (setup phase — where `FeeJuicePaymentMethodWithClaim` places it). An app-phase claim under a sponsored fee must use plain `claim`, or it asserts on EVERY attempt — which looks exactly like a slow L1→L2 message sync if the retry loop swallows errors. Print the caught error on the retry cadence, and when a claim "never syncs", independently check the message witness (`node_getL1ToL2MessageMembershipWitness` with the key from the portal's deposit event) before blaming the network.
- Blanket `biome check --write` on test trees converts `vi.fn(function () {…})` mocks to arrows and breaks `new`-constructed service-client mocks (~95 failures) — format only the files you touched.

- **CI's toolchain npm resolve has no lockfile, only a 7-day gate.** `.github/actions/setup-aztec`
  holds the installer's `npm install` to npm's `min-release-age=7`, with `@aztec-labs/*` and
  `@aztec-foundation/*` exempt, so an un-pinned transitive arrives a week after it publishes, not on
  publish day, and an exact third-party pin younger than that fails the cold install with
  `ETARGET` (wait it out). Before the gate, `snappy@7.4.0` (broken Node entry chain —
  unconditionally reaches the never-installed-on-linux `@napi-rs/snappy-wasm32-wasi` fallback)
  killed every fresh CI sandbox boot the day it published, while local runs stayed green on
  pre-publish `~/.aztec` trees. A broken release still lands once it is a week old: diagnose via
  publish-time correlation + a bare local `npm install` repro under the same two `npm_config_*`
  settings (fresh install in a scratch HOME, then `node -e "require('<pkg>')"` against the version
  dir) before rerunning CI.
- **The first CI run on a new line has no toolchain cache.** Every job downloads the Aztec CLI's
  pieces from GitHub releases, so one HTTP 500 fails a job before any test (6.0.0-rc.1: Foundry's
  attestation file, the noir tarball). Once a run has saved `Linux-aztec-<pin>-<pins hash>-v3`
  (any re-pin changes the key too), `gh run rerun <id> --failed`.
- **presto-server's bb fetch calls the GitHub API with no token** to check bb's digest. On a host
  whose 60-an-hour anonymous budget other agents share, it returns 403 for up to an hour, so read
  `api.github.com/rate_limit` before reading it as code. For local prover-ON canaries, give
  presto-server a private `PRESTO_HOME` and send one warm-up prove once the budget has room, so a
  missing bb fails before the suite instead of as a canary result. CI hands the server the
  workflow token (`PRESTO_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`); a personal token would make it a keyed run.
- **Upstream's JSON-RPC client prints the node URL**: in its debug fetch line, its error-level
  retry line and the errors it throws (`Error fetching from host <url>`). The Testnet endpoint
  carries its API key in the path, so a script that reads it goes through the silent single-read
  client (`createPreflightNodeClient` in `apps/extension/scripts/seed-preflight-node.ts`) and
  prints origins only.

- **Standards/token package swaps: noir struct paths are NOT stable across dep graphs.** The same
  `AztecAddress` param can arrive as `aztec::protocol_types::…::AztecAddress` from one compile and
  `authorization_contract::aztec::protocol_types::…::AztecAddress` (crate-prefixed by the artifact's
  import chain) from another. Any exact-path ABI matching silently zeroes out — in the wallet this
  made every balance/transfer descriptor resolve no candidates, so token imports returned
  `isComplete: false` and the popup dead-ended with "Couldn't auto-detect this token's interface"
  (the whole network suite red via `importToken` timeouts, mislabeled a "hang"). Match struct paths
  suffix-tolerantly (`matchesStructPath` in
  `apps/extension/src/wallet/services/token/functions/descriptors.ts`) and, after ANY standards bump,
  run `descriptors-real-artifact.test.ts` — it pins all nine token-fn kinds against the REAL installed
  artifact and is the first thing that must go red if upstream reshapes the ABI. Also remember 5.x
  `loadContractArtifact` splits public fns into `artifact.nonDispatchPublicFunctions` — a raw-JSON
  diff is NOT what the wallet's matcher sees; probe through the package's own `Token.js` export.
