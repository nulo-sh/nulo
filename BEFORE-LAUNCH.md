# Before launch — what is still blank, and when each blank is due

The Terms and the Privacy Policy ship with `«FILL: …»` placeholders: facts that cannot be read out
of this repository. While any survives, `nulo.sh/terms` and `/privacy` carry a **DRAFT banner and
`noindex`**, so nothing here blocks a merge. It blocks **v1.0.0**.

Find every one: `git grep -n "«FILL" -- legal/`. What each one needs is described in
[`legal/README.md` § Placeholders](./legal/README.md#placeholders). This file is the schedule.

## 1. Any time before v1.0.0 — look these up, do not guess

**Done** for the privacy policy, every row below; the Terms carry the same security URL and Presto
links. Each filled fact reads in place in `legal/privacy.md` and `legal/terms.md`.

| Fill | Where | How to find it |
|---|---|---|
| Email provider's legal name + privacy link | `legal/privacy.md` § 5.5 | The provider behind `hello@nulo.sh` |
| Cloudflare contracting entity + privacy link | `legal/privacy.md` § 5.5 | Cloudflare's customer agreement names the entity for your country |
| What the dRPC account exposes to you | `legal/privacy.md` § 5.1 | Open the dashboard and list the categories you can actually see, or confirm you see none |
| What the Cloudflare dashboard exposes to you | `legal/privacy.md` § 5.5 | Same: open it, list it |
| Retention ×3 (website/security records, correspondence, provider schedules) | `legal/privacy.md` § 5.5 | State the real period or the real criterion |
| Transfer safeguards (provider → destination → adequacy decision or SCCs, UK included) | `legal/privacy.md` § 12 | From each provider's DPA |
| EU/UK Article 27 representative | `legal/privacy.md` § 10 | Only if required. **Delete the line** if not; never leave it blank |
| Security-reporting URL | `legal/terms.md` § 24, `legal/privacy.md` § 13 | A URL that resolves for a reader outside the repo (`SECURITY.md` is a repo path) |
| Presto's own licence + privacy links | `legal/terms.md` § 7, `legal/privacy.md` § 5.8 | Published by the Presto native app |

## 2. When the store listings exist

| Fill | Where |
|---|---|
| ~~Chrome Web Store listing URL~~ | `legal/terms.md` § 1 — done |
| ~~Firefox Add-ons listing URL~~ | `legal/terms.md` § 1 — done |

Also at this point, not a placeholder but the same deadline: the **Chrome trader disclosure**
([`legal/README.md`](./legal/README.md), blocker 5) is declared non-trader; it must be re-declared
before any funding, revenue or entity. If the trader path applies, Chrome displays a verified address
and phone number publicly, and no clause can waive that.

The store dashboards are filled from `apps/extension/store/listing.md` (one source for both stores;
`apps/extension/scripts/store-listing.test.ts` holds it to the manifests and to the privacy
policy). Before the first submission the privacy page must have lost its DRAFT banner, which takes
two things: every `«FILL»` in § 1 above is filled (a reviewer who opens `nulo.sh/privacy` reads
them), **and the privacy policy's effective date is set to the planned submission day** — the
banner stays while any placeholder survives, and the date is one. Set it in three places, two in
`legal/privacy.md` (tests hold the version line to the manifest, not the history row's date):

- [x] `legal/privacy.md` — the version line at the top (1.0's now lives in
      `legal/archive/privacy-1.0.md`), and the 1.0 row of the history table
- [x] `packages/legal/src/manifest.ts` — `effective` for `privacy` 1.0

The Terms' listing URLs were filled once both first submissions existed. Their
effective date waits for § 3, the 1.0 ship day, so `/terms` stays draft a little longer, which the
stores do not mind — they require a reachable privacy policy, not terms. Nulo V6 reuses both store
items, renamed. Both URLs in `legal/terms.md` § 1 name the item by its ID (Chrome's item id, AMO's
add-on id `3077967`), which each store redirects to the current listing, so no rename touches them.

Also before submission, one wording item in the privacy policy that is not a placeholder: § 2
attributes "loads no remote code" to the content security policy, which only forbids remote
*scripts* — WASM bytes are kept local by the bundled loaders, not the policy
(`apps/extension/store/remote-code.md` § What this bears on). **Done:** § 2 reads "forbids
loading remote scripts".

## 3. The day v1.0.0 ships — in the `release: promote dev → main` PR that carries it

The Terms' **effective date** is the date the 1.0 listing goes live (privacy 1.0's is already set,
§ 2). It appears in three places, two in `legal/terms.md` (tests hold the version line to the
manifest, not the history row's date), so change them together:

- [ ] `legal/terms.md` — the version line at the top, and the 1.0 row of the history table
- [ ] `packages/legal/src/manifest.ts` — `effective` for `terms` 1.0 (currently `null`)
- [ ] `legal/privacy.md` + its manifest entries — 1.0 and 1.1 already dated, confirm unchanged;
      1.1.1 per § 4

Then:

- [ ] `git grep -n "«FILL" -- legal/` prints nothing
- [ ] Both listing URLs in `legal/terms.md` § 1 open the live listings (a store serves an item's
      public page only once it has published it)
- [ ] `bun run --cwd packages/legal test` and `bun run --cwd apps/landing test` are green
- [ ] After the deploy, `nulo.sh/terms/v1.0/` shows **no DRAFT banner** and no `noindex` meta
- [ ] The README's "DEMO / PREVIEW BUILD — NOT A PRODUCTION WALLET" banner is rewritten

## 4. Every later `release: promote dev → main`

Nothing to fill unless `legal/terms.md` or `legal/privacy.md` changed since the last release. If one
did, it needs a new version before it reaches users — procedure in
[`packages/legal/README.md` § Shipping a new version](./packages/legal/README.md#shipping-a-new-version):
archive the old text, bump the version line, add the history row **with its effective date**, append
the manifest entry, and mark it `material: true` with hand-written `changes` if people must
re-accept. `git diff <last release tag> -- legal/` answers whether any of this applies.

**Due at the first release:** privacy 1.1.1 (the address for reporting security vulnerabilities) is
archived, versioned and effective 6 October 2026:

- [x] `legal/privacy.md` — the version line and the 1.1.1 history row
- [x] `packages/legal/src/manifest.ts` — `effective` for `privacy` 1.1.1
- [ ] After the deploy, `nulo.sh/privacy` shows no DRAFT banner, and AMO's Privacy policy field
  carries the 1.1.1 text (`apps/extension/store/listing.md` § Privacy policy text)

## Not legal text, same deadline

- Firefox `data_collection_permissions` (`financialAndPaymentInfo`) and the Firefox 153 minimum
  are settled and pinned by `apps/extension/src/manifest.test.ts`; the reasoning is in
  `apps/extension/store/listing.md` § Data collection declaration.
