/**
 * Every third-party action is pinned to a full commit SHA.
 *
 * A tag is a mutable pointer owned by the action's maintainers — or by whoever takes over their
 * account. `@v4` re-resolves on every run, so a moved tag executes new code with the job's token
 * and secrets and leaves no diff here to review. A 40-hex SHA is content-addressed: the code that
 * runs is the code that was reviewed, and an upgrade is a line in a PR.
 *
 * The trailing `# vX.Y.Z` is not decoration: it names the release the SHA belongs to, for a human
 * reading a diff and for any tool that proposes the next digest.
