# Verify one certification trigger against the qualifying criteria below.
#
# A run QUALIFIES when, for the given head SHA:
#   - ALL THREE required workflows ran (Quality, Extension smoke e2e, Extension network e2e);
#   - each completed successfully, at attempt 1 (a re-run means the first
#     attempt was not green);
#   - no job in them failed or was cancelled;
#   - no successful job's runtime log contains a vitest retry marker or an
#     exit-86 / infra-reboot warning (a pass that consumed a retry is not a
#     green);
#   - the runs executed their WORKLOAD jobs by name — the network agent set, smoke's
#     test job, and quality's unit/lint jobs — so a suite that resolved run=false and
#     produced a green "passed or was skipped" aggregator cannot certify with nothing
#     having run.
#
# It fails CLOSED: any API call that does not return usable data is a violation,
# never a skipped check. `set -e` is deliberately not used — the script
# accumulates violations so one invocation reports all of them — so every
# command's failure is handled explicitly.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-cd/verify-cert-run.sh <head-sha>
#   scripts/ci-cd/verify-cert-run.sh --pr <number>
#
# Exits 0 only when the run qualifies, 1 when it does not — including when the
# evidence needed to judge it could not be fetched, since "we could not check"
# is not "it passed" — and 2 only for a usage error or an unusable environment
# (no gh auth, unresolvable repo/PR, no temp dir), where no verdict is possible
# at all.

# `decide` job resolved run=false still produces a green aggregator ("passed or
# was skipped" is by design for unrelated changes) and would certify with no
# tests having run at all. Certification is a claim that the suites RAN and were
# green, so label the PR to force them rather than accepting a skip.
