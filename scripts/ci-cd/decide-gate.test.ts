/**
 * Behavioral pin for the e2e `Decide` gates.
 *
 * Its sibling `behavior-gating.test.ts` pins which PATHS each filter covers. This pins what the
 * gate then DOES with that answer, which is where a defect hides: a paths clause additionally
 * conditioned on `github.base_ref == "dev"` would stop every arc ABOVE a stack's bottom — whose
 * base is the arc below it, not `dev` — from reaching the suite by paths, skip it, and have the
 * aggregator report success-on-skip.
 *
 * So this executes the gate script itself against a table of inputs rather than asserting on its
 * text: a rule that re-appears in a different spelling still fails here.
 *
 * Wired into CI via the root `test:ci-gating` script in `_unit-tests.yml`.
