/**
 * Fast local enforcement of the complexity-budget baseline (sub-second: one git grep).
 * Chained into `bun run lint` and the pre-commit hook so a violation reds the agent's
 * local loop, not just CI. The tree must match the manifest exactly, entry by entry.
 * scripts/ci-cd/complexity-baseline.test.ts is the CI mirror and adds the ratchet against
 * the PR's base branch (a hand-edited manifest passes here but not there);
 * scripts/ci-cd/complexity-rescore.test.ts holds every stamp to the function's observed value
 * (that one needs Biome, so it is CI + on-demand: `bun run baseline:rescore`).
