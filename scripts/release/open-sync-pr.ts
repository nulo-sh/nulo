/**
 * Decision core for the post-release `main → dev` sync. Two pure pieces; the
 * branch/PR/label side-effects are workflow glue.
 *
 *  1. `syncEligible` — the trigger guard. The sync must fire ONLY on the
 *     `push:main` that just merged a stable Release PR, NOT on a
 *     `workflow_dispatch` republish of an old tag (which would re-touch the
 *     sync flow for, e.g., v1.2.3).
 *  2. `decideSyncPrAction` — given GitHub's computed mergeability, never do a
 *     local merge: open the PR and either leave it mergeable or label it for a
 *     human. Fail-closed: anything not cleanly MERGEABLE gets surfaced, never
 *     silently dropped.
