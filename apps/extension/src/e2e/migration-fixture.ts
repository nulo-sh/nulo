/**
 * E2E fixture migration — proves the migration machinery end-to-end through
 * the real boot path (smoke suite: `tests/e2e/migration.test.ts`).
 *
 * Registered ONLY when the build was stamped with
 * `VITE_NULO_E2E_MIGRATION_FIXTURE=1` (see `./config.ts`): the registry
 * spreads it behind the static-false constant, so production builds
 * tree-shake this module and the `_build-extension.yml` negative grep asserts
 * its marker never ships. It transforms only rows under its own test-only
 * root, which no real install has — inert even if it somehow ran.
 *
 * Test controls (both OUTSIDE the declared footprint, deliberately — a
 * footprint key would be snapshotted into the pre-migration backup and
 * restored on failure, resurrecting a "throw" toggle forever; these are
 * read-only test knobs, never written by the migration):
 * - `nulo:e2e:migration-boom` present ⇒ `up()` throws (exercises fail-closed
 *   → blocked UX → clear the key → next boot retries forward).
 * - `nulo:e2e:migration-hold` present ⇒ `up()` waits until it clears
 *   (safety-capped), letting a test observe the mid-migration barrier or kill
 *   the SW mid-flight.
