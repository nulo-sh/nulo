/**
 * The e2e proof gate, backed by `chrome.storage.session`.

 * Presence-only protocol: while {@link PROOF_GATE_KEY} is PRESENT, `wait()`
 * blocks; when it is ABSENT, `wait()` resolves. Behaviour:
 *
 * - Event-driven: subscribes to `chrome.storage.onChanged` so a release is
 *   observed immediately, not polled.
 * - Safety timeout: a forgotten release resolves loudly after
 *   {@link SAFETY_TIMEOUT_MS} so the suite never deadlocks — the test fails
 *   on its own assertion instead of hanging.
 * - `chrome.storage.session` (not `local`) so the key dies with the
 *   browser profile; the gate also `remove()`s it on release/timeout so a
 *   forgotten hold can't bleed into a later test in the same session.
 *
 * Lives in the extension shell (touches `chrome.*`), NOT
 * `@nulo/aztec-runtime`, and runs in the SERVICE WORKER — the offscreen
 * document has no `chrome.storage`. Constructed only inside the static-false
 * `if (E2E_PROVERLESS)` branch in `wallet/runtime.ts` (a normal top-level
 * import), so prod builds tree-shake this module — its `onChanged` listener +
 * the `nulo:e2e:proof-gate` key — out entirely. (A dynamic `import()` was
 * tried and rejected: rollup ships a code-split chunk for it even when dead.)
 * That absence (not storage write-access) is the production trust boundary,
 * enforced by the `_build-extension.yml` negative grep.
