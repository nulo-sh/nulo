/**
 * Test double for `NodeFactory`. Returns a deterministic in-memory
 * `AztecNode` handle keyed by the rpcUrl passed to `createNode`.
 *
 * Callers can register per-URL overrides to make `getNodeInfo()` /
 * `getBlockNumber()` / etc. return specific values, or supply a
 * shared template that every URL receives.
 *
 * WARNING: A POJO `AztecNode` satisfies the interface structurally but
 * bypasses the `createSafeJsonRpcClient` proxy's param validation and
 * error marshalling. Unit tests driving `NetworkService` / code that
 * relies on JSON-RPC error surfaces (e.g. `NetworkService.getChainId`'s
 * catch block) will go green against this fake even if the real code
 * path would throw against a live node. Use integration tests against
 * the production adapter for those paths.
