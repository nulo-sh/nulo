/**
 * Where a popup lands when the boot-time session check finds NO open session. Pure over a
 * snapshot of the shell's state so every branch — including the one only a service-worker
 * restart produces — is unit-testable without mounting the shell.
 *
 * The restart case: a popup that was authenticated keeps its Pinia state (a selected profile,
 * an auth-required page rendered) while the replacement worker holds no session. Keying the
 * decision on the ROUTE rather than the logged-in flag matters — the header flips that flag
 * before the worker answers a Lock click, so a flag-keyed decision would leave such a popup
 * parked on the page it was showing.
 *
 * A run over an ESTABLISHED page never selects a candidate: a page with no profile selected that
 * survives a restart owns its own flow (an import mid-restore, the register or reset rituals), and
 * routing it to the lock screen would unmount that flow. Selecting the candidate is the landing of
 * a run that has no page yet — the initial boot, a RETRY, or a reconnect whose mount-time boot was
 * lost before the router resolved (a disconnect that rejected the route guard's first read). An own
 * window (`utils/own-window.ts`) is established from its first boot: its page is the flow it opened for.
