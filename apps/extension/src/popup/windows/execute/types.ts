/**
 * Shared types for the dApp Execute approval window.
 *
 * Why a `Draft*` type set: send-like ops (`send_transaction`, `aztec_sendTx`)
 * declare `feeSettings: FeeSettings` (non-optional) in the wallet-bridge
 * contract — that's the executable Operation shape the SW expects after
 * approval. While the popup is open, however, the user may not yet have
 * picked a fee method; the row exists with `feeSettings === undefined`.
 *
 * Pre-Phase-2-followup, this gap was papered over with `feeSettings: undefined!`
 * non-null assertions at the init site, which let a popup-side bug ship
 * an undefined-feeSettings op to the SW and surface as a `TypeError:
 * Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'priorityLevel')`.
 *
 * The fix:
 *
 * 1. This file declares `DraftOperation` — the same union as `Operation`
 *    but with `feeSettings` honestly optional on send-likes.
 * 2. The popup `index.vue` + `OperationCard.vue` both type their rows as
 *    `DraftUIOperation` (Draft + UI-only fields).
 * 3. `operation-validation.ts` provides `requiresFeeSelection` (UX gate)
 *    and `assertExecutableOperation` (type-narrowing assertion) used at
 *    the approve handler to safely cast Draft → executable Operation.
 *
 * The wallet-bridge `Operation` type is intentionally NOT changed —
 * loosening it would weaken a contract that is otherwise correctly enforced
 * everywhere else.
