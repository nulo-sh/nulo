/**
 * Network-switch orchestration, extracted from the popup shell's watcher so
 * the identity fence is unit-testable (app.vue has no test harness — an
 * unpinned inline fence is silently revertible). The factory owns ALL the
 * glue: the per-component fence, entry invalidation, scope capture, and the
 * compound run guard.
 *
 * The hazard this closes: the watcher's RPCs enjoy pre-registration
 * immunity (a request parked before the transport registers it survives
 * `disconnect()`), so a superseded run used to land a cross-chain account
 * list after the user had already switched again. Every await boundary now
 * re-checks BOTH the generation (a newer run started) AND the live scope (a
 * profile/network drift the watcher hasn't re-fired for yet), and results
 * are committed only after the check — never in the same statement as the
 * await.
