 * Suppress pending chain txs that are already represented by an in-flight

 *
 * Bug pinned: a previous blanket filter hid T1's pending chain tx as soon
 * as T1's journal record transitioned to `succeeded`, while T2 was still
 * in-flight. T1 vanished from the feed (succeeded → returns null from
 * the terminal-card resolver, AND its chain tx was suppressed because
 * T2 was in-flight). Came back only after T1's chain tx left `pending`.
 *
 * Per-hash scoping: suppress chain txs whose hash matches an in-flight
 * journal record currently in `submitting` stage (the one in-flight
 * stage whose schema permits a `txHash`, populated at all four
 * `execution/service.ts:markJournal({ stage: "submitting", txHash })`
 * call sites). Records in queued / pending / simulating / proving stages
 * don't have a chain tx yet, so they pull nothing through this filter
 * and T1's pending chain tx stays visible while T2 is anywhere in the
 * pre-submit lifecycle.
 *
 * Drift safety: the FSM invariant in `operation-journal/service.ts:_transitionLocked`
 * enforces `submitting.txHash === succeeded.txHash` so a future hash-fn
 * change can't silently no-op the filter — the FSM throws first.
