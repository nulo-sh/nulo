/**
 * Popup-side service-client registry.
 *
 * Historically this was `core.js` with module-eval side effects — importing
 * it opened `ProfileServiceClient` + `ContactServiceClient` ports eagerly,
 * which made the module impossible to import in tests without a live SW and
 * caused phantom ports when multiple popup surfaces loaded the bundle.
 *
 * The public shape (`managers`, `isBackgroundConnected`, `initTransactionService`,
 * `refreshBalances`) is preserved — every existing consumer keeps working
 * unchanged. Under the hood:
 *   1. `managers` is a Proxy; client construction is deferred until first
 *      access (or until `initAppServiceContext()` is called explicitly).
 *   2. `initAppServiceContext()` is the explicit boot hook. Called from
 *      `popup/index.ts` at startup to preserve the old eager-init timing.
 *
 * Tests that import `@/utils/core` without calling `initAppServiceContext()`
 * and without touching `managers` pay nothing. Tests that want the real
 * clients can still call the init explicitly.

 * {@link requireNetwork}/{@link requireAccount} (throw if unset) for method calls
 * in unlock-guarded code, or {@link getNetwork}/{@link getTransaction}/
 * {@link getAccount} (`| null`) where the unset case is tolerated. Runtime is unchanged: the slots hold `null` before assignment exactly
 * as the prior `null as unknown as Client` lie did.
