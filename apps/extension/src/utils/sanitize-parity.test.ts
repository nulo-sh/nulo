/**
 * Enforce the "byte-identical" pin both sanitizeString copies claim in
 * their comments. `@nulo/design`'s internal `sanitize.ts` is a deliberate copy
 * of the extension's `utils/string.ts` `sanitizeString` (design can't import the
 * extension). Each side is unit-tested in isolation, so a future edit to one
 * regex would pass both suites while silently diverging. This test runs one
 * shared fixture table through BOTH real implementations and asserts identical
 * output, converting the comment's claim into an enforced invariant.
 *
 * The design copy is `internal` (no package export), so it is imported by
 * source path — that boundary-crossing is the entire point of the parity check.
