/**
 * Whether the wallet's own send is in flight.
 *
 * A popup transfer snapshots the popup's active account and network into its
 * arguments when the user presses Send, so the only thing that can move the
 * ground under it is that same popup changing scope. The guard holds the scope
 * still until the send is broadcast or terminal.
 *
 * dApp sends are not counted. They carry their own account and network, and
 * they fail closed when the session that authorized them ends, so the guard
 * has nothing to protect — and counting them would hand any connected site a
 * hold on the user's switching for the life of its transaction.
 *
 * Cancelling a send terminalizes its record, which clears the guard. Locking
 * the wallet is never blocked — it is a security action and must always work.
