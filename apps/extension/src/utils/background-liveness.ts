/**
 * Causal wait for the wallet service worker's liveness signal to ADVANCE.
 *
 * `nulo:liveness` (chrome.storage.session) has exactly one writer: the SW
 * runtime, which writes it immediately after `services.start()` + the SDK
 * handler are wired ("runtime is fully wired and ready to handle messages" —
 * wallet/runtime.ts) and then re-writes it on a 10s heartbeat. A STRICTLY
 * LATER value than a caller's baseline therefore proves a fully-wired worker
 * completed startup after that baseline was read — the signal a crash-recovery
 * caller needs before re-issuing work into the MV3 respawn gap, where new
 * calls otherwise reject in milliseconds against doomed ports.
 *
 * The baseline may already BE the new worker's first write; that is fine — the
 * heartbeat supplies the next strictly-later value within ~10s, so the wait
 * self-heals (it proves "a wired worker exists NOW", not worker identity).
 * Liveness is wall-clock (`clock.now()`): a clock step-back stalls
 * "strictly-later" until real time recovers, which lands on the ceiling —
 * fail-closed, tolerated.
 *
 * Two concurrent observers — a storage `onChanged` subscription (with a
 * post-subscribe re-read closing the subscribe race) AND a 1s value poll —
 * so delivery quirks of either mechanism cannot starve the wait; both legs
 * are causal (the signal is the VALUE advancing, not time passing). The
 * ceiling exists only to surface failure to the caller, never as the
 * success mechanism.
