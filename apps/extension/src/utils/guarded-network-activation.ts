 * newer one finished and overwrite the user's later intent. The tail is
 * rejection-proof: a throwing activation must not wedge every future switch.
 * (Cross-window: realms don't share this chain; each view converges to the
 * durable pointer on its own bootstrap — recorded follow-up, not attempted.)

/**
 * Activate a network without letting the durable pointer escape the in-flight-
 * send guard. Order inside one activation: the guard admits (and moves the
 * in-memory scope) BEFORE the service persists, so a refusal moves NOTHING.
 *
 * A persist failure is INDETERMINATE — the RPC can fail after the durable
 * write landed. Reconcile by reading the authoritative pointer and committing
 * it back THROUGH the guard: if a send started in the admitted scope in the
 * meantime, the guard refuses, the view keeps that send's activity visible,
 * and the caller reports the switch unconfirmed; the next popup bootstrap
 * converges. A blind unguarded revert did neither.
 *
 * The activation captures its profile at enqueue: if the wallet re-scoped to
 * another profile while this was queued (lock → unlock another profile), the
 * queued target belongs to a foreign profile and the activation is dropped
 * as "stale" before touching anything.
