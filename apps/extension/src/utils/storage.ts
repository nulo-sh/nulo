/**
 * Migration-aware facade over `chrome.storage.local` — the ONLY way UI code
 * (popup / onboarding / stores / composables) may touch local storage.
 *
 * Why: the boot migrator transforms persisted records under a durable
 * `nulo:schema:running` marker. UI pages are separate JS contexts that don't
 * share the service worker's in-memory state, so without a barrier a page
 * opened mid-migration could read a pre-migration row and write it back,
 * corrupting the transform. Every accessor here waits for the marker to clear
 * before touching data. Enforced by `storage-facade-ban.test.ts` (scans for
 * raw `chrome.storage.local` outside this file + the composition-root adapter).
 *
 * Deliberately NO timeout: proceeding while a migration is mid-flight is the
 * corruption we're preventing. Liveness leans on the engine's journal — every
 * ENGINE RUN clears the marker on its way out (success, failure, resume), but
 * the boot GATE can short-circuit engineless over a blocked status, so a
 * `running` marker stranded beside a blocked one (the restore-failure state)
 * keeps waiters here pending until a gesture retry or the backstop authorizes
 * the next run. The shell covers it: `MigrationBarrier.vue` ranks blocked
 * above updating, so the user sees the recovery screen, never a silent hang.
 *
 * Residual TOCTOU, accepted: the barrier is check-then-act, not a lock — a
 * write dispatched in the gap between the idle check and the marker being set
 * can land inside a migration's snapshot window. The marker spans the WHOLE
 * run (no inter-migration gaps), which shrinks the window to SW-boot-instant;
 * true mutual exclusion needs the deferred route-all-UI-storage-through-the-SW
 * follow-up.
