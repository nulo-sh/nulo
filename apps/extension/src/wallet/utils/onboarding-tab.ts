 * Open or focus the onboarding tab. Callable from any extension context
 * (service worker, popup, side-panel) since `chrome.tabs.*` and
 * `chrome.storage.session` are available everywhere.
 *
 * Concurrency: a module-level promise lock collapses concurrent calls into a
 * single in-flight open. Necessary because `onInstalled` (background) and
 * `register.vue` mount (popup) can race on a fresh install — both contexts
 * are different module graphs but each individually only sees one call at a
 * time. The lock keeps each context internally single-flight; the cross-
 * context race resolves naturally because the popup almost always loses
 * (chrome opens the popup AFTER firing onInstalled).
 *
 * Session-storage tab-id tracking is best-effort. chrome.storage.session is
 * cleared on reload/update/disable/browser-restart, so a stored id can
 * outlive itself — in that case we open a fresh tab and orphan the old one.
 * Acceptable; user can close the duplicate.
