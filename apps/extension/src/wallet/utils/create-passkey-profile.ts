 * userHandle in sync with the persisted profile id.
 *
 * Scope is bounded to (a) reserve an id, (b) run the ceremony,
 * (c) call createPasskeyProfile, (d) retry once on conflict. The caller
 * owns ALL post-create side effects — `chrome.storage.local` writes,
 * bootstrap orchestration, routing, etc.
 *
 * @throws ProfileIdConflictError if both attempts hit the conflict.
 * @throws UserRejectedError if the ceremony was cancelled.
 * @throws Other Error from the service-client.
