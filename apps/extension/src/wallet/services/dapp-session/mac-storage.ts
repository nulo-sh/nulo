 * quarantine-deleted — no legacy verifier, no repair from stored contents. When
 * the profile is **locked** (the key provider throws) the row is hidden
 * (returned absent) but NOT deleted, since it is legitimate and verifies again
 * after unlock — fail-closed: a locked read yields no sessions, never a

	 *
	 *  1. It runs the MAC key provider, which THROWS for an INACTIVE profile (the
	 *     common deletion case) → rows hidden, left behind, revived on re-import.
	 *  2. It runs the codec, which KEEPS-but-hides a schema-invalid row → a row
	 *     with `profileId=P` but e.g. a missing field survives the profile purge.
	 *  3. It has no key info, so a caller would delete by the row's SELF-REPORTED
	 *     `id`; a valid row copied to a different storage key (alias) would not be
	 *     removed and would re-verify after a same-secret re-import.
	 *
	 * `rawEntries()` sidesteps all three: raw JSON (no codec / no MAC) keyed by the
