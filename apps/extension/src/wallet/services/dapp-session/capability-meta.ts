 * in user-controlled local storage (contact-book names — the user typed
 * them but could have pasted a Unicode-attack payload).
 *
 * What `stripWireControl` strips:
 *
 *   1. Every Unicode "format" codepoint (`\p{Cf}`). This includes:
 *      - Bidi overrides (LRE/RLE/PDF/LRO/RLO + LRI/RLI/FSI/PDI).
 *      - Zero-width joiners and non-joiners (ZWSP / ZWNJ / ZWJ).
 *      - Left/right marks (LRM / RLM).
 *      - Soft hyphen (U+00AD).
 *      - Byte-order mark (U+FEFF).
 *      - Tag characters (U+E0000-U+E007F).
 *      Without this, a hostile dApp could embed an RLO and visually
 *      flip the displayed text direction, or a zero-width joiner to
 *      glue two different glyphs together. A narrower class than the
 *      full \p{Cf} range misses ZWSP and the soft hyphen.
 *   2. Variation selectors (U+FE00..U+FE0F, U+E0100..U+E01EF). Single
 *      codepoints that change the visual rendering of the preceding
 *      character. Not in \p{Cf}; categorised \p{Mn}, so we list them
 *      explicitly.
 *   3. The C0 / DEL / C1 control codepoints (U+0000-U+001F, U+007F,
 *      U+0080-U+009F).
 *
 * `stripWireControl` does the strip step only — used for clipboard
 * payloads where length-clamping would be worse UX (a user verifies a
 * trimmed display and copies the full value; we don't want to silently
 * truncate the clipboard, but we also don't want the clipboard to
 * carry invisible-injected bytes either).
 *
 * `sanitizeWireString` runs the strip step AND a `maxLen`-codepoint
 * clamp with an ellipsis. Soft cap chosen per-callsite: 64 for function
 * selectors, 128 for addresses / class IDs, 32 for the unknown-
 * capability `type` and contact-name annotations.
 *
 * What is NOT stripped: legitimate combining marks (\p{Mn} minus the
 * variation-selector ranges) and unusual-but-printable spaces (NBSP,
 * etc.). Stripping those would over-mangle user-typed contact names
 * with diacritics. Combining-mark attacks (zalgo text) are out of
 * scope here; we'd want a UTS39-class normalization step for that.
 *
 * Vue template interpolation already HTML-escapes; we don't try to
 * handle angle brackets etc. here.
