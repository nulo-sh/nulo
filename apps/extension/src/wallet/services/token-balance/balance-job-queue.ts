/**
 * Background work scheduling for `TokenBalanceService`. Wraps:
 * - `Queue<number, TokenBalanceRaw>` (dedup by id via `priorityPass`)
 * - `pendingTasks: Map<number, string>` (per-id → TaskService id)
 * - `BackgroundTickerPort` subscription
 * - Projection + storage-write fan-out
 *
 * Two dedup layers:
 * - `Queue.priorityPass(balance)` prevents double-sync of an already-
 *   queued balance (keyed by `x => x.id`).
 * - `pendingTasks` per-id map prevents double-creation of a TaskService
 *   record when a balance is enqueued from multiple triggers in quick
 *   succession.
 *
 * Tick semantics — preserved verbatim from the previous `startWorker`
 * loop:
 * - On each tick: if the queue is non-empty, drain it UNTIL EMPTY,
 *   batching into up-to-12 items grouped by the first-queued account,
 *   calling the projector for each batch.
 * - Not "one batch per tick."
 * - If any async work in the tick throws, the error is logged and the
 *   tick ends (the port's error-containment contract keeps future
 *   ticks firing).
