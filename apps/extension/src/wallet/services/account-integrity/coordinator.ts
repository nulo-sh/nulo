 * AccountService — it writes the durable block + closes the session itself, delegate-independently,
 * so a mismatch during the startup window before this coordinator starts is still fail-closed.)
 * A mismatch means this build derives different addresses than the profile's stored accounts —
 * wrong build for the profile's address regime, or tampered rows. Response: withhold/close the
 * session, persist a blocking record that survives SW restarts (read raw by the popup barrier),
