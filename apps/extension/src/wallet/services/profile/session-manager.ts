/**
 * `SessionManager` — owns the in-memory `ActiveSession` and its
 * persisted `Session` mirror in `chrome.storage.session`.
 *
 * `ProfileService` is the facade: it keeps the lock and the RPC
 * surface. This class owns session state and TTL expiry.
 *
 * ## Storage ownership
 *
 * Frozen storage key: `nulo:core:session` in `chrome.storage.session`.
 * Session storage is cleared by the browser when the service-worker's
 * "browser session" ends, but survives MV3 service-worker suspensions —
 * which is the whole point: the popup can reconnect mid-session without
 * re-prompting for the password.
 *
 * The persisted shape (`Session`) is frozen across the ProfileService
 * split; every existing session record on disk was written under this
 * encoding. The in-memory shape (`ActiveSession`) is a superset — it
 * also holds the raw `Fr` master secret, which is NEVER persisted.
 *
 * ## Restore semantics (init-only, silent)
 *
 * `restore(lookup)` is called exactly once during service init.
 * It re-hydrates `activeSession` from disk without emitting
 * `onActiveProfileChanged`. Emitting at init would fire before any
 * subscriber has attached; subscribers pull the current value via
 * `getActive()` at their own mount time.
 *
 * Restore is also TTL-aware: a session whose `since + ttl` has passed
 * is silently dropped (storage cleaned, no emit — matches the "session
 * expired on reload" UX).
 *
 * ## Bearer / corrupted-ciphertext policy
 *
 * The silent-restore bearer is a random-token-wrapped master secret
 * (`SessionSecretBox`), not the old password-equivalent passhash. On any
 * wrong-profile / tampered-bearer / bad-tag condition `unwrap` returns
 * `null` and the manager maps that to a silent close, same as TTL expiry.
 * A legacy `passhash`-shaped session is never accepted (one-time re-unlock).
 * The facade does NOT see an error — there is no UI to surface one to
 * during init.
 *
 * ## Lock-agnostic
 *
 * SessionManager performs no locking of its own. Callers (the facade)
 * run its methods under `ProfileService.lock` when they need
 * serialization with profile CRUD. Init is called before the service
 * announces readiness (`ensureInitialized`), so the lock isn't
 * required there either.
