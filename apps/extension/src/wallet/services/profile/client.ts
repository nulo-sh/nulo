	 * Snapshot-with-subscribe pattern.
	 *
	 * Preferred over `onActiveProfileChanged.add(...)` + manual
	 * `getActiveProfile()`. Does three things in one call:
	 *
	 *   1. Fetches the current active profile and fires `handler` once
	 *      with it (the snapshot). If no profile is active, `handler` is
	 *      called with `undefined`.
	 *   2. Subscribes to `onActiveProfileChanged` so every subsequent
	 *      change fires `handler`.
	 *   3. On `onConnected` (SW restart / reconnect), re-fetches the
	 *      current state and re-fires `handler` — otherwise events
	 *      emitted during the disconnect window would be lost.
	 *
	 * Returns an unsubscribe function that detaches both the event and
	 * the reconnect hook. Consumers **should** call it from `onBeforeUnmount`.
	 *
	 * Known edge case: an event fired between the snapshot `getActiveProfile`
	 * resolve and the `add(...)` call below is lost. The window is a real RPC
	 * round-trip (not a microtask) — accepted; a future hardening could buffer
	 * emits during this window and flush after the snapshot.
