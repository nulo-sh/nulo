/**
 * `PasskeyRecoveryCoordinator` — passkey-side half of the profile flow.
 *
 * Wraps the lower-level `PasskeyService` with a wallet-level semantic
 * interface:
 *   - Create a passkey credential bound to a new profile.
 *   - Recover the master secret from an existing credential (by id for
 *     the unlock path, or without one for the import path).
 *   - Confirm the user still holds the key bound to a profile.
 *
 * Pure coordinator: no storage, no session state, no passwords, no
 * locking. The facade serializes cross-collaborator workflows.
 *
 * ## Lock scope contract
 *
 * WebAuthn prompts take up to 3 minutes (the user must physically touch
 * the authenticator). The `ProfileService` lock has a 5-minute safety
 * force-release; holding it across a WebAuthn prompt is legal in theory
 * but pathological in practice. Every passkey path follows the same
 * shape: **callers MUST run the prompt unlocked**, then re-enter the
 * lock for storage writes. The coordinator itself is lock-agnostic and
 * makes no locking assumptions. `service.ts:221-274` shows the
 * snapshot → unlocked-prompt → revalidate-under-lock pattern.
