/**
 * SHALLOW_PXE_FAKE_BUNDLE_MARKER — the shared, dumb fake of the contract-registry
 * PXE slice (`ShallowPxe`) for in-process composition tests.
 *
 * Lives under `src/` ON PURPOSE so `vue-tsc` typechecks it and `biome` lints it:
 * because it `implements ShallowPxe` structurally, a shape change on the real
 * `IPXE` breaks `typecheck` here — that is the compile-time drift guard. It is
 * imported ONLY by `*.composition.test.ts` files; the production build never
 * imports it, and a CI step greps `dist/chrome|firefox` for the marker (carried
 * as live data on the factory's return, so it survives tree-shaking) and fails
 * on any hit (bundle hygiene). See `apps/extension/tests/COMPOSITION-TESTS.md`.
 *
 * DUMB BY CONTRACT: canned returns + a registered-address set. No Aztec
 * semantics, no proving/simulation (the `ShallowPxe` port can't express them).
