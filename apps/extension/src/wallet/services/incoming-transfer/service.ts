 *   - AccountService — currently-active account address

 *   - NoteService — `getNotesRaw` for the raw NoteDao fields
 *
 * Discovery loop:
 *   ONE singleflight scheduler per (networkId, accountAddress). Each tick
 *   iterates the registered contract list and calls
 *   `noteService.getNotesRaw(networkId, account, contract)`. For each note,
 *   the 3-source dedupe gates record creation: prior records

 *   `progress.txHash`.
 *
 * Trust state machine (per `(profileId, networkId, contract)`):
 *   unknown → first note → pending (hidden, popup prompts)
 *   pending → all queued records stay hidden until user resolves
 *   Allow → trusted; queued records visible, emit Added for each
 *   Reject → blocked; queued records stay hidden silently
 *   trusted → subsequent records insert visible
 *   blocked → subsequent records insert hidden (silent)
 *
 * Late-delete reconciliation: when `TransactionService.onTransactionAdded`
 * fires, any existing record whose txHash matches is deleted — closes the
 * proving→submitting race window for self-mint / change-note cases that
 * arrived via PXE before the local tx was journalled.
