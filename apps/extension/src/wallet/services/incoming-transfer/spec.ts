 *
 * Scope guarantees:
 *   - Records are keyed by `siloedNullifier` — cryptographically unique per
 *     note, so duplicate inserts are idempotent.
 *   - Dedupe runs against three sources: prior records (siloedNullifier
 *     equality), the user's own outgoing tx hashes (TransactionService),
 *     and in-flight journal records with a `progress.txHash` (OperationJournal).
 *   - Pollution defense via the `IncomingTrustState` state machine:
 *     `unknown` → first note arrival → `pending` (record hidden, popup
 *     prompts user) → `trusted` (record visible + future receives auto-
 *     display) OR `blocked` (records stay hidden forever).
 *   - Scope is locked to fungible-token receives for tokens the user has
 *     explicitly added. NFTs + unknown-contract notes are out.
