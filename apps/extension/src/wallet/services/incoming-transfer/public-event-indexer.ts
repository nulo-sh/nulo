/**
 * `PublicEventIndexer` — the injected collaborator that owns the public-`Transfer` RPC paging loop,
 * cross-page cursor validation, the page budget, and the recipient pre-filter.
 *
 * It NEVER touches storage: it returns decoded+validated events plus a proposed cursor advance, and
 * the `IncomingTransferService` remains the sole writer of records / trust / cursors / outbox. The
 * per-page hostile-response hardening (monotonicity, checkpointed-tip bound, per-item decode
 * isolation) already lives offscreen in `@nulo/aztec-runtime`'s `fetchPublicTokenTransferEvents`;
 * this module adds the cross-page monotonicity guard and stops at the budget.
 *
 * A `referenceBlock`-reorg throw from the reader propagates UNCHANGED — it is the reorg detection
 * signal the service catches to trigger reconciliation.
