/**
 * Durable-job reaper.
 *
 * MV3 service-worker suspend is unobservable to in-flight work. If the
 * SW dies mid-prove and the offscreen survives, the prove completes
 * but the SW (a fresh instance after wake) has no record of the
 * pending request — the offscreen's response message is dropped on
 * arrival because no `requestId` matches. The journal record sits in
 * `proving` forever.
 *
 * The reaper closes that loop with TWO sweep modes:
 *
 * 1. **Boot sweep** (aggressive, `unconditional: true`): runs once at
 *    `start()`. Marks EVERY non-terminal record as failed, ignoring
 *    grace windows. The rationale: a fresh SW has an empty pending-
 *    request map, so any record in proving/submitting from a previous
 *    SW lifetime is unrecoverable regardless of how recently it started.
 *    Error kind = `sw_restart_post_prove` (proving) / `stale_on_resume`
 *    (others) per the documented `JobError.kind` set.
 *
 * 2. **Periodic tick** (chrome.alarms, every 1 min): respects the
 *    per-stage grace windows. Catches records that get stuck within
 *    a single SW lifetime — rare, but possible if a downstream call
 *    hangs without throwing. Error kind = `stuck_proving` (proving) /
 *    `stale_on_resume` (others).
 *
 * Either way, the popup observes the transition via the journal
 * client's `subscribeJob` and shows the user a real terminal state
 * instead of an indefinite "Proving…" spinner.
 *
 * The reaper never tries to RECOVER lost work — Aztec proofs are
 * block-anchored, the offscreen instance that held the proof artifact
 * may have died too, and even if alive its in-memory state isn't
 * addressable from a fresh SW. Marking the record `failed` is the
 * honest outcome.
 *
 * Cleanup: chain-scoped journal purge already runs via
 * `OperationJournalService.clearChainState` (W1, wired into
 * `NetworkService.purgeChain`'s cascade). The reaper doesn't duplicate
 * that — it only reaps stuck records, not chain-removed ones.
