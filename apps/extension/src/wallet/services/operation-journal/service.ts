/**
 * Durable operation journal.
 *
 * Storage-first service — no orchestration or business logic. Consumers
 * (ExecutionService, dApp interaction flows) drive transitions; this service
 * persists them, validates FSM legality via `@nulo/wallet-core/jobs`, and
 * fans out events. Its ONLY calls out are the creation fences: profile
 * existence + deletion epoch (ProfileService) and network liveness
 * (NetworkService), both optional so minimal fixtures run unfenced.
 *
 * Invariants owned here:
 *   - origin + profileId required at create-time (NewOperationInput schema)
 *   - terminal records keep `terminalAt`; `deleteOperation` is only for
 *     explicit cleanup (chain purge) — terminal stages don't auto-delete
 *   - progress is the tagged union from wallet-core/jobs
 *   - error preserved with `normalizedRaw`
 *   - attempts counter defaults to 0; consumers increment on retry
