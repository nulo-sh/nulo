/**
 * Terminal-record GC sweep for the operation journal.
 *
 * The journal keeps terminal records (succeeded / failed /
 * cancelled) instead of auto-deleting them — tombstones serve idempotency
 * checks and the activity card history. With no bound, those tombstones
 * accumulate forever in `chrome.storage.local`. The UI caps the home-tab
 * preview at 5 rows, so the bloat is visually invisible up to thousands of
 * records, but the storage quota is finite.
 *
 * The GC sweep mirrors {@link JournalReaper} but watches the *terminal*
 * subset: it groups records by `(profileId, accountAddress ?? null)` and
 * enforces a per-scope cap, evicting the oldest by `terminalAt`. The
 * reaper handles non-terminal stuck records; the two paths never touch the
 * same record set.
 *
 * **Eviction policy**: only `succeeded` records
 * are evictable. Failed and cancelled records have NO on-chain truth
 * elsewhere — they exist only in this journal, so losing them is real
 * data loss for the user. Succeeded records correspond to confirmed
 * on-chain transactions; their history is re-derivable from PXE + the
 * tx hash, so capping them keeps storage bounded without losing
 * irretrievable state. Failed/cancelled records still count toward the
 * group when grouping by scope, but are skipped during the eviction-
 * candidate selection.
 *
 * `accountAddress`-less terminal records (a failed token-import before the
 * account scope was set, for instance) cluster under a synthetic
 * `(profileId, null)` bucket with the same cap.
