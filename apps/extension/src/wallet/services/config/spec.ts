 * Config keys a backup restore may write. Presentation-only by design: security keys
 * (`strictSecurityMode`, `sessionTtl`) and diagnostic toggles are deliberately absent, so an
 * imported backup can never widen the wallet's security posture.
 *
 * Lives in the spec rather than the service because it is DATA two places need: the service
 * enforces it on restore, and the restore-error collector relies on it to know that a config row's
 * `key` is drawn from a fixed set and is therefore safe to name in a log.
