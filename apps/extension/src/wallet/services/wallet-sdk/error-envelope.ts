/**
 * Convert an internal exception into the `WalletResponse.error` shape expected
 * by `@aztec-labs/wallet-sdk`. Structured errors get EIP-1193 codes plus a
 * `walletErrorCode` discriminator; everything else collapses to a plain string
 * so the existing wire contract (string error for unrecognised throws) is
 * preserved.
 *
 * Pure — no I/O, no logger, no service dependencies. Lives next to
 * `background.ts` because the EIP-1193 mapping is a wallet-sdk transport
 * concern, not a wallet-bridge domain concern. Unit-testable via the
 * sibling `error-envelope.test.ts`.
 *
 * Wire reality: the dApp-side `@aztec-labs/wallet-sdk` wrapper at
 * `extension_wallet.ts:181` wraps `response.error` in
 * `new Error(JSON.stringify(error))`. dApps that want to discriminate must
 * `JSON.parse(err.message).code` (see wallet-bridge README for the recipe).
