/**
 * Per-origin admission for dApp handshakes that the wallet will approve without a user gesture
 * (a remembered session) or that will open a verify window.
 *
 * Two budgets, both keyed on the page origin: a token bucket bounds how fast a remembered origin
 * is re-approved (a reload loop is slowed, not blocked), and a window budget bounds how many verify
 * windows an origin can have open or reserved at once. A handshake that fits runs at once; one that
 * does not waits in a bounded FIFO and is served when a token refills or a window closes, or is
 * rejected once its discovery deadline passes. Admission happens BEFORE the approval so a session
 * is never live with its verification merely queued.
 *
 * A window slot is reserved at admission and released only when the window it produced is gone:
 * releasing on session termination alone would let an origin connect, keep the window, close the
 * tab and reconnect past the cap, and releasing while a creation is in flight would let a
 * replacement open before the original window appears. A connect window that waits for its
 * channel is attached to the slot (standby) and shows the check itself, under the same rule.
