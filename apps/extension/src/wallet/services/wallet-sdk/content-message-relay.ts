/**
 * Cold-wake message relay: the SINGLE `chrome.runtime.onMessage` listener for
 * content-script wallet-sdk traffic.
 *
 * MV3: when a content-script `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` WAKES a dead service
 * worker, the event is dispatched the moment the SW's top level has executed —
 * only listeners registered synchronously at module scope receive it. The SDK
 * handler's listener attaches at the tail of `runtime.start()` (after
 * migrations, config/BB init, `services.start()`), so the waking message used
 * to be dropped. `registerContentMessageRelay()` is called synchronously from
 * the SW entry module; `attachContentListener()` is called by the transport's
 * `addContentListener` once the SDK handler exists — buffered messages flush
 * FIFO through the SAME validated path live messages take.
 *
 * Single-listener ownership is load-bearing: a second listener alongside the
 * SDK-attached one would double-deliver, and a duplicate discovery's
 * coalesce→reject path DELETES the entry its twin legitimately queued, while a
 * duplicate secure-message would double-journal a sendTx. The transport must
 * therefore attach here instead of registering its own chrome listener.
 *
 * Drain is keyed on ATTACH, never on `runtime.start()`'s promise — even under
 * the single-flight memo (which settles only when the boot genuinely finishes
 * or fails), a failed boot resolves nothing and the handler may never attach.
 * If boot never reaches attachment the bounded buffer dies with the unusable
 * worker.
 *
 * Pre-attach admission is deliberately STRICTER than the live path: only a
 * validated, top-frame `discovery-request` may occupy a buffer slot.
 * Discovery is the one message type that is both stateless at the handler and
 * worth replaying (every other type is gated on in-memory session state that
 * did not survive the SW death anyway), and content scripts run in ALL frames
 * on ALL origins — without admission control, rejected iframe/malformed/flood
 * traffic could fill the buffer during the boot window and starve a different
 * tab's legitimate cold-wake discovery. Caps mirror the connect-popup posture
 * (reject-new, never evict). Flushed messages re-run the live path's
 * validation at attach — harmlessly, the checks are pure.
