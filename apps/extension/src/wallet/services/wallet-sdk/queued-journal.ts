/**
 * Best-effort "queued" journal-record creation at wallet-sdk message arrival.
 *
 * Extracted from `background.ts` so the cap + pre-auth + parsing logic is
 * unit-testable without spinning up the full BackgroundConnectionHandler.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - Skip queued visibility when:
 *       - no active profile
 *       - no matching dapp session
 *       - no `transaction` capability grant
 *       - per-session cap reached (MAX_QUEUED_PER_SESSION)
 *       - global cap reached (MAX_QUEUED_GLOBAL)
 *   - Skip ONLY for `sendTx` messages — caller is responsible for routing.
 *   - Cap enforcement is atomic via `queuedCreationLock` — without this,
 *     concurrent arrivals all see a stale count and the cap is advisory
 *     rather than protective.
