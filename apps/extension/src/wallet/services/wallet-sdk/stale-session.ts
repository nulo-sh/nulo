/**
 * The reply for a session this background does not hold for the sender's tab.
 *
 * Sessions live only in the background's memory, so a restart forgets every one while the page's
 * SDK still holds its channel: its heartbeat and its calls would be dropped in silence, and the
 * dApp waits out its own 300 s ceiling. `session-disconnected` is the one message a peer with no
 * shared key can still act on — the content script closes the port it holds for that id and the
 * page's SDK rejects every in-flight call at once. So a message that presupposes an established
 * session and names one the handler does not hold for that tab is answered with it, to the tab the
 * browser says it came from, instead of being forwarded to a handler that would only drop it.
 *
 * A session another tab holds is answered exactly like an absent one: a page that names ids it
 * never owned learns nothing about which are live, and the tab that owns one is never written to.
