/**
 * The tab-lifecycle wiring extracted from `initWalletSdkHandler`'s
 * closure root. Registers the two `chrome.tabs` listeners that bound a dApp
 * session's life to its tab. Pure side-effecting registration — no unsubscribe
 * (nothing tears down in a service worker); MUST be called before
 * `handler.initialize()`, at the same position the inline block held.
 *
 * URL visibility — the onUpdated guard below is MOSTLY DEAD, verified
 * empirically (the two-sided pin in
 * tests/e2e/network/session-tabNavigate.test.ts): `changeInfo.url` is
 * permission-gated on "tabs" (not declared) or an EXPLICIT `host_permissions`
 * match for the tab's new URL (only nulo.sh + 127.0.0.1 in this manifest; a
 * runtime tab-specific/site-access grant would be another route, none exists
 * in the default state). The content script's all-URLs `matches` pattern does
 * NOT count — tabs-API scrubbing checks explicit hosts, not scriptable hosts.
 * So for a navigation to an ordinary web origin the cross-origin branch never
 * sees a URL and cannot fire; it executes only when the DESTINATION is an
 * explicitly host-permitted origin. Making it live for all origins would
 * require adding the "tabs" permission — a store-listing-visible manifest
 * change, owner-gated, deliberately NOT shipped here.
 *
 * That is acceptable because the guard is bookkeeping hygiene + reconnect UX,
 * NOT a security control. The boundary is realm teardown, not session-id
 * secrecy (the PAGE generates the discovery requestId that becomes the
 * sessionId, so it is not a secret from the dApp): navigation destroys both
 * MessagePort ends and the content script's per-document ports map, and the
 * ECDH sharedKey dies with that realm — a stale ActiveSession is inert
 * memory. Cleanup holds without URL visibility: tabs.onRemoved (fires without
 * any URL grant), SW eviction, the DappSession deletion sweep, and the 7-day
 * TTL.
