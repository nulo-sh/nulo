/**
 * Per-session FIFO baton primitive used by `onWalletMessage`.
 *
 * The baton replaces the original "single Promise chained on handler
 * completion" FIFO. It advances when the handler EITHER:
 *   (a) explicitly calls `releaseFifo()` mid-execution (sendTx does this
 *       after tx-build), OR
 *   (b) completes (safety-net `.finally(releaseFifo)`),
 * whichever fires first. Lets concurrent dApp sendTx proceed past the
 * popup-wait phase while previous proving continues in the background.
 *
 * Extracted from `background.ts` so the baton mechanics + safety-net +
 * idempotence are unit-testable without spinning up the full
 * BackgroundConnectionHandler.
