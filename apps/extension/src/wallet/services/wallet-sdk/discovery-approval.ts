/**
 * Finalize a new-dApp discovery once its session has been persisted: approve
 * it, or roll it back.
 *
 * The durable writes that create the session (addDappSession +
 * setCapabilityGrants) can themselves cross the dApp's discovery window —
 * storage contention, service-worker suspension, or the machine sleeping mid
 * `await`. So freshness is re-checked HERE, immediately before the approval,
 * NOT only at the popup boundary. If the discovery expired during those writes
 * the just-created session is deleted (best effort — a genuine storage failure
 * can still leave the row, but approval fails closed regardless), no
 * verification is scheduled, and the discovery is rejected — so an
 * approved-but-unreachable, or unverified-yet-live, session is not handed to a
 * dApp that has stopped listening. An attempt abandoned during the writes (its
 * connect window closed) is rolled back the same way.
 *
 * @returns `true` iff the discovery was approved; `false` on rollback or when
 *   the SDK reports the approval did not land (the request was already gone).
