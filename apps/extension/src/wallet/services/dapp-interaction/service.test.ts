/**
 * DappInteractionService — execution-hook forwarding (v3 parallel popups).
 *
 * Contract: DappInteractionService FORWARDS the execution hooks bag to
 * `executeOperations` — it must NOT fire `onExecutionEnqueued` itself. The
 * baton release fires downstream in `ExecutionService.acquireExecutionSlot`,
 * once the request has enqueued on the execution mutex (which is what preserves
 * execution order across concurrent popups). These tests pin "hooks reach
 * executeOperations intact, and are not fired prematurely at the popup/silent
 * seam" — the field-name + threading half of the wiring whose drift left the
 * release dead pre-v3.
 *
 * Construction injects partial service mocks directly — standing up the full
 * six-service graph `init()` pulls would be far heavier than the seam under
 * test warrants. `chrome.*` is stubbed by tests/vitest.setup.ts.
