/**
 * The one place a stored dApp request becomes an operation. Both the silent auto-approve path and
 * the service worker's popup-approval path call `materializeRequest(req, deps)` and get the same
 * `DraftOperation` shape after CAIP resolution; `feeSettings` is honestly optional on a draft.
 *
 * The silent path narrows Draft → executable `Operation` with `assertSilentExecutable` (it only
 * ever sees self-fee'd requests — `isConfirmationNeeded` gates the rest — so a non-executable draft
 * there is a drift alarm). The popup path materializes for display; the executable operation is
 * rebuilt SW-side from the stored request at confirm, and the popup supplies only a per-index fee
 * selection, never an operation.
 *
 * Network/account resolution is injected via `MaterializeDeps` so the function is unit-testable
 * without service-collection setup.
