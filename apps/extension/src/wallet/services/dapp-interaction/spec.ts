 * Execution-side hooks carried across the popup handoff.
 *
 * The user-approval popup splits the request handling into two phases:
 *
 *   1) `interaction()` opens the popup, returns a `handle.promise` that
 *      resolves with the final ExecutionResult.
 *   2) After the user approves, the popup calls `approveInteraction(id, ...)`
 *      which then dispatches `executeAndResolve` to actually run the operation.
 *
 * The hooks must survive that gap — they're set on the interaction record at
 * step 1, picked up by `executeAndResolve` at step 2. Without this storage,
 * the hooks would die at step 1's return and the post-popup execution path
 * would never see them.
 *
 * Aliases wallet-bridge's `IExecutionHooks` (rather than re-declaring the same
 * optional shape) so the field set stays in lockstep with the dispatcher's
 * contract: a one-sided rename on either side is a build error, not a silent
 * runtime no-op. `onExecutionEnqueued` fires once the request has enqueued on
 * the execution mutex — see `ExecutionService.acquireExecutionSlot`.
