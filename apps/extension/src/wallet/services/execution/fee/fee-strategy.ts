/**
 * `FeeStrategy` — fee-payment strategy family. Replaces the 4-way
 * switch inside `buildAndEstimateTxRequest` with a polymorphic strategy
 * interface. Each impl owns its own fee-payload injection +
 * simulate-and-finalize sequence:
 *
 *   - `FeeJuiceStrategy` (kind "fj") — plain FeeJuice, single-pass
 *   - `FeeJuiceWithClaimStrategy` (kind "fjwc") — prepend claim payload
 *   - `FpcStrategy` (kind "fpc") — two-pass: estimate with FJ first, then
 *     compute maxFee, prepend FPC fee payload, re-simulate with External
 *   - `EmbeddedStrategy` (kind "embedded") — dApp's own FPC; maxFeesPerGas
 *     is capped before simulation and committed as is, within its budget
 *
 * Shared helpers + the dispatch map live here. Per-strategy impls live
 * in `./{fee-juice,fee-juice-with-claim,fpc,embedded}-strategy.ts`.
 *
 * ## Return shape
 *
 * Strategies return a `FeeEstimate` — the `BuiltStandardTx` bundle plus
 * the `feePaymentMethod` the strategy resolved. Named fields are the
 * contract; the old positional 8-tuple was a silent-transposition hazard.
 *
 * ## Action array mutation (preserved)
 *
 * FJWC and FPC both mutate `ctx.op.actions` via `unshift` / `splice`.
 * That was intentional in the original code — the op passed in is
 * already a defensive clone done by the facade right before dispatch.
 * Strategies operate on the cloned array; caller-side state stays
 * untouched.
 *
 * ## Priority multiplier
 *
 * `feeSettings.priorityLevel` ("normal" / "fast" / "urgent") maps to
 * a numeric multiplier via `PRIORITY_MULTIPLIERS` in `@nulo/wallet-bridge`.
 * All strategies get the pre-computed `feeMultiplier` in the context.
 * FJ / FJWC pass it to `finalizeGasLimits`; Embedded commits its capped
 * fee instead, so no multiplier applies there. FPC applies it to
 * `baseFees` BEFORE computing maxFee for the fee-payload actions.
