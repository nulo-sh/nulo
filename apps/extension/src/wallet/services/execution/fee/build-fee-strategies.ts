/**
 * The fee-strategy dispatch map as a pure, explicitly-typed
 * builder. The composition root (`ExecutionService.init()`) still constructs
 * `FeeStrategyDeps` at its original point — the eager/lazy capture modes of
 * every dependency are the CALLER's, unchanged — and still owns the field
 * assignment, so initialization order stays legible at the root. Keys are
 * deliberately literal, never derived from `strategy.kind`: a derived key
 * would silently accept a kind/slot mismatch; the composition pin asserts the
 * agreement instead.
