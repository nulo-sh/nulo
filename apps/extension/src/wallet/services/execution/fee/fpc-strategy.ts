/**
 * FpcStrategy — external FPC (Fee Payment Contract) fee payment (kind "fpc").
 *
 * TWO shapes, selected per resolved FPC row:
 *
 * ## Canonical-Sponsored fast path (single-pass)
 *
 * Eligibility (all wallet-side facts, never dApp input): handler type
 * DefaultSponsoredFpc AND `isProtocol` (the row's address equals the pinned
 * canonical SponsoredFPC address — artifact-derived, recomputed at read time
 * from the row's own chain; a cold protocol-address cache decorates
 * `isProtocol: false` and falls safely to two-pass) AND the operation carries
 * NO dApp-supplied gas limits (`op.fee.gasLimits`/`teardownGasLimits` — a
 * custom limit would constrain app+FPC here where the two-pass constrains the
 * app only, a behavior change; such ops stay two-pass).
 *
 * Why single-pass is byte-honest for this contract and only this contract:
 * `sponsor_unconditionally` takes no arguments and reads nothing from the
 * transaction's gas-settings envelope (verified against the Noir source), so
 * simulating it under `forEstimation` limits measures the same gas as under
 * Pass-1-derived limits, and the `maxFee` handed to `getFeePayload` is inert
 * (`args: []`). NOTE the shipped two-pass never rebuilt after its final
 * splice either — built bytes have never carried a post-sim `maxFee` — so the
 * placeholder-`maxFee` build is the status quo, not a relaxation. A
 * budget-asserting `fpc`-kind contract (the embedded-cap class) would fail
 * estimation loudly under the huge `forEstimation` envelope — fail-loud is
 * the accepted posture; PrivateFPC never reaches this path at all.
 *
 * ## Two-pass (PrivateFPC + every non-canonical/user-added FPC)
 *
 *   Pass 1: build + simulate with FeeJuice to get total gas used
 *   Between: fetch baseFees (with priority multiplier), compute maxFee,
 *     prepend FPC fee payload to op.actions
 *   Pass 2: re-build + re-simulate with External + override gasSettings
 *   Finish: re-compute maxFee with padded gas, splice in final fee payload
 *
 * Pass 1 is LOAD-BEARING for PrivateFPC: its Noir `pay_fee` computes
 * `max_gas_cost` from the transaction's gas-settings envelope, so the FPC
 * call must simulate under the bounded Pass-1-derived envelope, never under
 * `forEstimation` limits. Do NOT extend the fast path to it.
 *
 * ## Folded (probed) runs — dApp estimate paths only
 *
 * When `ctx.probe` is set (exclusively by the `DiscoveryAwareEstimator` fold
 * routing), the FIRST sim of either path runs STUBBED (+`skipTxValidation`)
 * and doubles as authwit discovery — the standalone discovery sim disappears.
 * The stub's gas measures byte-identical to validated on live testnet
 * (side-effect-priced gas; the stub only removes constraints). Safety rails:
 * - Two-pass P1 is FPC-payload-FREE, so stubbing it never stubs a
 *   payload-inclusive sim for a non-canonical row (the hard limit); Pass 2
 *   stays validated and verifies the freshly signed witnesses.
 * - Fast path (canonical Sponsored only): no effects ⇒ done in one stubbed
 *   sim; effects ⇒ validated rebuild + re-sim before any estimate leaves.
 * - Ops carrying pre-attached authwits never reach a probed run (guarded
 *   upstream): a stub would mask a broken supplied witness.
 *
 * ## Finalization fidelity (both paths)
 *
 * `finalizeGasLimits(node, txRequest, sim, padding, baseFees)` — the
 * multiplier is pre-baked into `baseFees`, and there is deliberately NO
 * `customLimits`/`feeMultiplier` argument (fjwc's arg list would double-apply
 * the multiplier and newly honor `op.fee.gasLimits`).
 *
 * ## Action array mutation (CAUTION)
 *
 * Both paths mutate `op.actions` (unshift, then `splice(0, len, ...)` with
 * `originalActions` captured up front). This sequence is intentional and
 * load-bearing. Do NOT refactor to a
 * non-mutating shape without re-verifying the TxExecutionRequest bytes match
 * the original pipeline.
