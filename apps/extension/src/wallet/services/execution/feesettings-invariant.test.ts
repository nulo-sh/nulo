/**
 * SW boundary invariant for feeSettings on send-like operations.
 *
 * `approveInteraction()` (`dapp-interaction/service.ts:82-94`) is a JS-context
 * trust boundary — it ships popup-built operations straight through to
 * `executionService.executeOperations()` with no further validation. If
 * the popup ever leaks a draft op with `feeSettings === undefined`,
 * downstream code would dereference `feeSettings.priorityLevel` /
 * `feeSettings.paymentMethod.kind` and crash with a confusing
 * `TypeError`. The invariant at the entry of each execute method
 * surfaces a clear, attributable error instead.
 *
 * The checks live on `DappSendExecutor` (the facade methods are thin
 * delegates), positioned before any dep is touched — so the executor is
 * constructed with stub deps that are never reached on these paths.
