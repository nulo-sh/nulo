/**
 * Per-key FIFO mutex serializing dApp transaction EXECUTION within a
 * `(profileId, chainId)` scope.
 *
 * Why a bespoke primitive instead of `@nulo/wallet-core`'s `Lock`: that lock
 * force-releases after 5 minutes to avoid deadlocks. Proving on a slow runner
 * legitimately exceeds 5 minutes, and a force-release mid-prove would let the
 * next transaction start building against the PXE while the holder is still
 * proving — exactly the stale-private-note interleaving this mutex exists to
 * prevent. So: NO timeout, NO force-release.
 *
 * Correctness role (see implementations-plan/archive/dapp-interaction-lock-fix/plan.md#parallel-popups):
 * once the FIFO baton is released at popup approval, two approved sendTx can
 * both reach execution. `withPxeWrite` serializes individual PXE calls but NOT
 * the build→simulate→prove→submit lifecycle, so without this mutex T1 and T2
 * could simulate against the same private-note snapshot and T2's tx would be
 * rejected on-chain (double-spent nullifier). The NO_FROM path has no nonce at
 * all, so it relies entirely on this serialization. Hold the mutex from before
 * authwit discovery through submit, for both send paths.
 *
 * Keyed `(profileId, chainId)` to match PXE's own `chainGuard` (one PXE runtime
 * per profile+chain). Per-account would under-serialize: two accounts on one
 * chain share the runtime and the chainGuard.
 *
 * Abort: `acquire` accepts an `AbortSignal` so a queued waiter (a "Queued"
 * journal record the user can cancel) can be released from the wait. Aborting
 * while waiting splices the waiter out WITHOUT breaking FIFO ordering for
 * everyone behind it (the successor still waits for the real prior holder).
