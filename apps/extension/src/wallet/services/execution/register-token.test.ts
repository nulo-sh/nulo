/**
 * F11 pins: `executeRegisterToken` binds the token write to ONE identity chain —
 * the fence captured at dispatch entry, tied to the ownership-checked network
 * row, threaded into `addToken` (no fresh mint at the commit). Prototype-call
 * with a minimal `this`: the method's surface is three service calls, so the
 * full ExecutionService init graph is deliberately not constructed.
