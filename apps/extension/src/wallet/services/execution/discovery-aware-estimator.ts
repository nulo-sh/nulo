/**
 * `DiscoveryAwareEstimator` — the ONE owner of "discover authwits, then
 * estimate" for the dApp send paths. Owned and invoked exclusively by
 * `DappSendExecutor`; the Send-page transfer flow and `executeSendTransaction`
 * use the probe-free validated pipeline and can never reach this class (the
 * split, distinctly-typed deps are the fence).
 *
 * TWO PIPELINES, routed per-op in `estimate`:
 * - CLASSIC (standalone stubbed discovery sim → splice discovered actions →
 *   validated strategy pipeline) — the pre-fold choreography, kept verbatim
 *   for every op the fold rules exclude.
 * - FOLDED (strategy's first sim runs stubbed with a `CollectingDiscoveryProbe`
 *   and doubles as discovery) — measured at 0.00% stub-vs-validated gas delta
 *   on live testnet; discovered effects force a validated rebuild so fresh
 *   witnesses are verified before any estimate leaves the pipeline.
 *
 * `DiscoveryProbe` is deliberately CHAIN-BOUND (this exact one-argument
 * "pure extractor" was proven impossible twice — message hashing needs live
 * `nodeInfo` behind `assertLiveChainIdentity`, fetched lazily ONLY when
 * effects exist). Dropping the live-chain assert would weaken authwit-hash
 * derivation against a drifted RPC — it is pinned as preserved.
