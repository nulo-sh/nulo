/**
 * EstimateCancelRegistry — cancellation + admission control for fee estimates.
 *
 * Estimates have no journal record, so `ExecutionLane.cancelJob` cannot cover
 * them; this registry is the estimate-side equivalent, keyed by a caller-minted
 * token instead of a journal id. Its contract:
 *
 * - **Admission is atomic against real work, not bookkeeping.** At most
 *   `MAX_ACTIVE_ESTIMATES_PER_PROFILE` UNSETTLED underlying jobs per profile.
 *   A cancelled job does NOT free capacity — the underlying simulation is
 *   non-preemptible and keeps its queue slot until it settles — so admission
 *   counts entries until `settle()`, never until cancel. A transport timeout
 *   does not end the work either: the caller settles an entry whose simulation
 *   timed out only once that simulation ends offscreen (its late answer, a send
 *   that failed after all, or its document gone) or its record expires, unless
 *   the TTL sweep reaps the entry first. Admission stays per profile, so such
 *   an entry also holds a place against the profile's estimates on other chains.
 * - **Overflow = cancel-oldest + coalesce-newest.** The newcomer parks in a
 *   single latest-wins pending slot per (profile, flowKey) and is admitted
 *   only when a job actually settles. A newer arrival on the same slot
 *   rejects the parked one with `JobCancelledSentinel`.
 * - **Duplicate tokens are rejected loudly** (a second estimate must never be
 *   able to clear the first one's entry by completing).
 * - **cancel = abort-if-running AND evict-if-stashed**, including after the
 *   job settled: `settle()` moves the token → estimateId mapping into a
 *   TTL-bounded settled map so a cancel racing completion still evicts the
 *   stashed signed tx request. `settle()` itself evicts instead of recording
 *   when the entry was aborted mid-flight — closing the stash-then-settle
 *   race window entirely.
 * - **Foreign/unknown tokens no-op silently** (existence non-disclosure,
 *   matching `cancelJob`).
 * - **TTL sweep** reaps entries whose runner died without settling (dead RPC,
 *   SW hiccup) so controllers can't leak until restart.
