/**
 * Integration smoke for `batchedViewSimulation` against a real sandbox PXE.
 *
 * Guarded by `describe.skipIf(!process.env.RUN_NETWORK_E2E)` per user
 * CLAUDE.md "external-system data → always include at least one real-data
 * integration test." Skipped in fast `bun run test`; enabled when the
 * e2e:agent harness runs with `RUN_NETWORK_E2E=1`.
 *
 * The unit tests in the sibling `.test.ts` file pin the helper's logic
 * (classification, batching, decode-failure isolation) via stub PXE. This
 * integration test pins the wire contract — the `.nested` vs
 * `.nested[1].nested` private-return branch quirk in particular, which
 * unit-level mocks can't faithfully reproduce because the real selection
 * depends on what `account.buildTxExecutionRequest` returns as
 * `txRequest.origin`.
 *
 * Fast-path integration coverage targets: compare encoded
 * Fr-array results from the fast arm (simulateViaNode against the chain
 * node directly) against the slow arm (pxe.simulateTx through the kernel)
 * for the SAME logical calls. Parity is byte-equality on the encoded
 * values only — gas-used and stats WILL differ (fast arm tracks gas
 * differently) and MUST NOT be asserted.
 *
 * TODO(network-test infra): wire this up to the existing sandbox
 * bootstrap in `apps/extension/tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`. Today the
 * unit tests provide >90% behavior-parity coverage including the
 * fast-arm partitioning, fallback policy, and concurrency invariants;
 * this file exists as the skeleton + check-list for the network-suite
 * extension.
