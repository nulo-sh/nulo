/**
 * `ExecutionLane` — the execution-lane state machine, moved verbatim off
 * the execution facade: the cancel-controller registry, the
 * per-(profileId, chainId) FIFO execution mutex, the queued-wait
 * heartbeat, the slot acquisition choreography, the queued-record claim
 * wrapper, and `cancelJob`.
 *
 * The facade consumes this as a handle and wires the executors' lane-
 * shaped deps to it. The lane also owns `dapp_execute` record CREATION
 * (`beginJournal`) — the single start path shared by the direct
 * `send_transaction` flow and the queued-claim flow.
 *
 * Frozen invariants (constraint registry — do not "fix" any of these):
 *   - The mutex has NO timeout and NO force-release. A wedged holder
 *     wedges the lane until SW restart; that is the chosen failure mode
 *     (silent overlap is worse — nullifier double-spends).
 *   - FIFO baton release point: `onEnqueued` fires after `acquire` is
 *     CALLED (synchronous enqueue) and before the grant is awaited.
 *   - `cancelJob` transitions the journal FIRST and aborts SECOND; an
 *     FSM rejection drops the cancel silently and never aborts.
 *   - `JobCancelledSentinel` never crosses the RPC boundary —
 *     `rpc-cancel.ts` stays the conversion point, caller-side.
 *   - Sync-register: the pre-acquire controller is registered under the
 *     queued id BEFORE `acquireSlot`'s first await, so a user-cancel
 *     during the wait always finds its controller.
