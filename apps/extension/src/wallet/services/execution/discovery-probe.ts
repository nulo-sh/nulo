/**
 * `CollectingDiscoveryProbe` — the concrete `DiscoveryProbe` handed to folded
 * strategy runs. It owns the three fold-safety rules:
 *
 * - **Chain-bound extraction**: the authwit message hash derives from the LIVE
 *   node's `getNodeInfo()`, fetched lazily ONLY when effects exist and
 *   checked against the stored network identity first (`liveChainInfo`). The
 *   decode loop is `decodeAuthwitEffects`, shared with the other discovery paths.
 * - **First-sim-only**: a probe instance responds to exactly ONE extraction.
 *   The folded two-pass runs Pass 2 with the discovered witnesses attached —
 *   the Pass-2 sim re-emits the same `CallAuthorizationRequest`s (Noir emits
 *   them unconditionally; measured live), so a second extraction would
 *   double-splice.
 * - **Dedup**: within one extraction, identical message hashes collapse to one
 *   action, and hashes already covered by pre-attached actions are dropped
 *   (belt-and-braces — the pre-attached-authwit guard upstream keeps pre-attached-authwit ops
 *   off the folded path entirely).
 *
 * The instance is per-estimate and stateful: `collected` is the executor's
 * bookkeeping surface (what discovery added), replacing the standalone
 * discovery sim's return value in the folded flow.
