/**
 * Pins the ExecutionService PXE construction seam.
 *
 * The existing execution suite bypasses construction via private-field
 * injection, so nothing else covers "with no factory supplied, production
 * builds the REAL PxeServiceClient". This pins exactly that: the default
 * factory (which `ExecutionService`'s constructor uses as its `pxeClientFactory`
 * default) produces the real RPC-backed client, so the new seam can't silently
 * make production run a fake. (`chrome.*` is stubbed by tests/vitest.setup.ts,
 * so constructing the real client here is safe — we never make an RPC call.)
