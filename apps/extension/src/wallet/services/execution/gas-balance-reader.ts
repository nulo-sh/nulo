 * `GasBalanceReader` — the gas-balance (FeeJuice) readout subsystem,

 * Owns the `${networkId}:${accountAddress}`-keyed TTL cache, the
 * single-flight dedup (fresh popup opens fire several concurrent
 * readouts — FeeSettingsCard + GasBalanceCard — and each independently
 * triggered FPC discovery before the guard existed), and the two-leg
 * compute: public FeeJuice via `balance_of_public` and the PrivateFPC's
 * `balance_of` when one is registered, as CONCURRENT independent
 * invocations with per-leg failure isolation (they ride different
 * arms — direct-to-node vs PXE — so they must not shared-fate).
 *
 * Invalidation is owned by the FACADE's event subscriptions (settled-tx
 * per-account; PrivateFPC mutation full sweep) — registration order in
 * `init()` is load-bearing and stays there. Invalidation MARKS STALE
 * rather than deleting: `get()` recomputes past-TTL entries either way,
 * while `peek()` keeps serving the last-known value so the UI can render
 * it dimmed instead of a skeleton (stale-while-revalidate).
