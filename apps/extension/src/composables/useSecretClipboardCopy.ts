/**
 * Secret-export clipboard copy with the post-copy scrub, extracted verbatim from
 * the key/seed export pages (which duplicated it word for word).
 *
 * Best-effort clipboard scrub a while after copy. Extension popups may
 * deny clipboard writes without a transient user gesture, so this is a bonus
 * layer — the on-page warning is the reliable mitigation. We deliberately do
 * NOT add a clipboardRead permission (it would only widen the wallet's
 * clipboard-read surface); the scrub is therefore unconditional, not
 * equals-checked, and is scheduled in the SAME tick as the copy — a hung
 * clipboard promise can never prevent it.
 *
 * NO lifecycle hooks and NO dispose() export, BY DESIGN — do not "fix" this
 * to the repo's usual composable-dispose convention: closing the export page
 * is a route-nav that keeps the popup's JS context alive, so cancelling the
 * scrub on unmount would make it near-inert in the common copy-then-close
 * flow. The timer only runs an idempotent `writeText("")` (no secret
 * reference, `.catch`-guarded) — safe to outlive the component, at the
 * documented small cost of clobbering an unrelated clipboard copy made
 * within the 60s window (accepted; no clipboardRead).
