/**
 * Bounded connectivity preflight for the import flow's chain-registration
 * leg. Pure orchestration over an injected probe; tests drive timing with
 * vitest fake timers (which patch both the deadline clock and the sleeper).
 *
 * Per network: up to `1 + backoffWaitsMs.length` probe attempts (exponential
 * backoff between them), each bounded BOTH by the SW-side probe budget
 * (`probeNodeStatus` aborts its socket at `timeoutMs`) and a page-side race
 * (in case the SW itself is unresponsive). The shared `deadlineAt` caps the
 * whole preflight — later attempts only get the remainder.
