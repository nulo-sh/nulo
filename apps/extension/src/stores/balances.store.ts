/**
 * The ONE popup-side owner of fee-juice balance + FPC-list fetching.
 *
 * Before this store, FeeSettingsCard and GasBalanceCard each carried a private
 * copy of the same machinery (init coalescing, raw-request reuse, retry
 * backoff, SWR peek, generation guards). The store owns app-lifetime service
 * clients (app.store `inFlightJournal` precedent: connect-once, never
 * disconnected) and a `(profileId, networkId, chainId, accountAddress)`-keyed
 * entry map (activity.store slice precedent); the cards are subscribers with
 * declared capabilities. The SW-side GasBalanceReader keeps its own TTL /
 * cross-document dedup role — this store's job is instance coalescing,
 * retry/degraded policy, and ONE connection lifecycle.
 *
 * Invariants (each pinned in balances.store.test.ts):
 * - Entries are PROFILE-scoped and epoch-fenced: a profile switch bumps the
 *   departing profile's epoch and clears its entries synchronously; fetches
 *   and raw flights are epoch-stamped; a superseded ensure CANCELS with the
 *   typed `EnsureSuperseded` — it never re-enters (the underlying RPCs bind
 *   to the SW's ACTIVE profile, so a stale flight must never be re-blessed).
 * - Raw RPC promises are reused across timed-out attempts (per key+leg+epoch):
 *   a retry re-attaches a fresh timeout to the SAME pending request — plain
 *   single-flight would re-stack uncancellable pre-connect RPCs.
 * - FORCED refreshes (tx-settle) never join a raw flight that predates the
 *   trigger: they wait the live flight out, then re-enter fresh.
 * - The gas slice separates `display` (last-known, SWR) from `verified`
 *   (cleared by any failed refresh) — display can keep painting while gating
 *   correctly sees unknown. Peek commits are version-guarded.
 * - Cause-specific signals: `version` (any commit), `retryVersion` (retry-path
 *   commits only — the degraded-recovery signal), `forcedVersion` (successful
 *   forced commits only — the optimistic-overlay reset signal). `retryDebt`
 *   is independent of slice status: only a successful retry-path commit
 *   clears it.
 * - Subscriber capabilities drive ALL traffic: legs fetched, backoff retry
 *   (only while a retry-capable subscriber holds the key), tx-settle refresh
 *   (only keys with a txRefresh-capable subscriber), and peek. Today's
 *   per-card traffic is reproduced by construction.
