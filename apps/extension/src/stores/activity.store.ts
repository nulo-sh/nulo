 * that resolved after a switch — landed wherever the user happened to be. This
 * store keeps one slice per `(profileId, networkId, chainId, accountAddress)`
 * and routes every record into the slice for the record's OWN scope. A foreign
 * record cannot reach the active view because it is not in that map entry at
 * all, which is a stronger guarantee than a filter someone has to remember.
 *
 * Switching scope is a pointer move, so the previous view reappears from cache
 * instead of clearing and refetching. (The DOM still has to render; only the
