/**
 * Fail-closed under a dead node: with NOTHING readable, the Send page pays with nothing, never shows
 * the account's own public Fee Juice as the payer, never claims "you have no gas" about balances
 * nobody read — and, with no token to send, says nothing about what a send would publish: no strip,
 * no fee-source tag, no "Review send".
 *
 * What this does NOT prove is the selection rule itself — with both balances unread, Fee Juice is
 * ineligible under any walk order, so a rule that wrongly defaulted to it on an unread PRIVATE balance
 * would still pass here. That case (private unread, public held) cannot be staged end to end: the
 * private leg is a PXE-local simulation, not an interceptable request. It is pinned where it can be —
 * `fee-privacy.test.ts` and the "by knowledge state" cases in `FeeSettingsCard.test.ts` — and the
 * funded shapes are covered against a real chain in `network/fee-methods.test.ts`.
 *
 * Every build seeds Testnet as the active network; its RPC origin is refused inside the browser, so
 * the run does not depend on the public endpoint being up or down.
