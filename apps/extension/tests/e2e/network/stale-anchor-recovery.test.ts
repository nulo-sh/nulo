/**
 * Stale-anchor recovery canary — the extension-level gate for the offscreen's resync-and-retry.
 *
 * A production PXE anchors on the node's tip before every op and queries the node by that
 * anchor's block hash. An L1 reorg that prunes the tip between the two makes the node reject the
 * hash ("… possibly a reorg has occurred"); the offscreen helper resyncs and retries once, logging
 * `stale anchor on first attempt — resynced, retrying once`. This spec drives that through the
 * real stack — playground dApp → wallet-sdk → service worker → offscreen PXE → node — and asserts:
 *
 *   1. HARD: every view issued across the reorg succeeds, and so does one issued after the node's
 *      prune has landed. The wallet survives an L1 reorg, whether the retry fired or the pre-op
 *      sync saw the prune first.
 *   2. SOFT: the retry line is in the service worker's log trail. Landing the prune inside the
 *      sync→query window is a race the test cannot pin from outside (it is exactly the window the
 *      helper exists for), so the spec drives a burst of views per reorg and tries a few reorgs.
 *      Reproduced → the line is asserted verbatim. Not reproduced after the budget → the test
 *      SKIPS with the reason; the delivery report carries the recovery as unmet at this layer
 *      (the real-PXE integration test in aztec-runtime pins it with a frozen anchor).
 *
 * Run it first, alone and armed:
 * `NULO_E2E_REORG=1 bun run e2e:agent tests/e2e/network/stale-anchor-recovery.test.ts`. Unarmed it
 * skips: the reorg leaves the local network unable to mine again, so inside a pooled run every later
 * spec that lands a transaction would time out on the shared sandbox. The reorg drops the tip L2
 * block, so a disposable mint lands first: the pruned block then carries nothing the view depends on
 * (pruning the token's own deployment block turns the view into a legitimate "Not initialized"
 * failure, which is not what this spec is about).
