/**
 * Concurrent sendTx — APPROVAL boundary (v3 parallel popups).
 *
 * Companion to concurrent-sendtx.test.ts (which rejects popup #1 and so never
 * exercises the baton release). This test pins the v3 activation: the session
 * FIFO baton is released at popup #1 APPROVAL, so popup #2 opens *while T1 is
 * still executing* — not after T1's full prove+submit.
 *
 * The discriminator vs the pre-v3 behavior is deterministic, not timing-based:
 * at the instant popup #2 opens, T1's journal record must be in an ACTIVE
 * (non-terminal) stage and T2's must still be `queued`. Pre-v3 the baton only
 * advanced at handler completion, so popup #2 could only appear once T1 had
 * already terminalized — the opposite of what we assert here.
 *
 * Cost control (keeps this in the standard matrix): T1 is approved with the
 * sponsored fee and left mid-prove. We assert the boundary, reject popup #2,
 * and let fixture teardown reap T1's in-flight prove. We never await T1's full
 * lifecycle — that (two sequential proves) is concurrent-sendtx-confirm's job.
 * Pre-mint is required so T1's simulate succeeds and it reaches the slow prove
 * phase, staying active long enough for the boundary snapshot.
