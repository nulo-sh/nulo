/**
 * A token whose balance row is gone must come back — with a real projection —
 * once the wallet is restarted and unlocked.
 *
 * The gap this repairs is produced in production by an MV3 worker death inside
 * `createTokenBalance`, between the token row landing and its balance backfill.
 * Seeding the gap directly is deliberate: parking a worker mid-write and killing
 * it there proves MV3 nondeterminism, not the recovery that actually shipped.
 *
 * Scope: this asserts END-TO-END recovery across restart + unlock. It does not
 * isolate the sweep's own enqueue — `auth.vue` refreshes balances on unlock — so
 * the enqueue itself is pinned by the service-level task-spy test instead.
