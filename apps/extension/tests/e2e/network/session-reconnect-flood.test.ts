 * property — the cap the reconnect gate enforces), the two beyond it wait rather than being
 * rejected, and once the open windows are approved every waiting tab connects. The precise
 * refill/close ordering is unit-tested deterministically; here the sandbox proves the cap holds
 * and no honest handshake is dropped, well inside the dApp's 60 s discovery window.
