/**
 * The in-flight-send switch guard, end to end.
 *
 * A send reads the active account while it builds and proves, so switching
 * mid-flight would let work already under way finish as the wrong account.
 * Rather than detect that drift and unwind it, the account switch is blocked
 * while a send is in flight.
 *
 * The proof gate parks a real send at `proving` — after the record is journaled,
 * before the proof completes — which is precisely the window the guard exists
 * to cover. Requires a PROVERLESS build (`NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS=1`): that is the
 * only build where the gate is compiled in. Run zero-retry
 * (`NULO_E2E_RETRY=0`) — the file mutates on-chain and PXE state, so a retry
 * would re-run against a half-consumed sandbox.
