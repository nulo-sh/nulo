/**
 * Auto-lock waits while an approved send is still proving, and still locks once the send is done.
 *
 * The proof gate parks a popup Send at `proving`, and an 8 s TTL expires while the proof is held.
 * The session must stay open with its deadline moved forward and its `since` untouched, which is a
 * deferral and not a refresh. Once the gate is released the send succeeds, and the wallet locks at
 * a following deadline. With an 8 s TTL one deferral step spends the whole budget, so that lock
 * cannot tell a finished send from a spent budget; the composition test of the deferral check
 * pins that the check turns false once the send settles.
 *
 * A deliberate departure from `account-switch-live-session`, where the send finishes because nothing
 * ends the session: here the session does end, and it waits only for approved work still running.
 *
 * Timing is read from the persisted row, not from elapsed time. Chrome may deliver a short alarm late
 * or not at all, so the test runs the expiry check itself through a read that does not refresh the
 * session.
 *
 * @requires-proverless — the proof gate exists only in a proverless build; the agent runner refuses
 * this file without `NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS=1`. Run it with `NULO_E2E_RETRY=0`: it spends on-chain and
 * PXE state that a retry would find half-consumed.
