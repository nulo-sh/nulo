/**
 * Cold-wake discovery loss: a dApp's discovery message is what WAKES a dead
 * service worker — chrome dispatches it the moment the SW's top level has
 * executed, but the wallet-sdk listener registers ASYNC at the tail of
 * `runtime.start()`, so the waking message is dropped before any listener
 * exists. One click is ONE DiscoveryRequest (the SDK provider never
 * re-broadcasts), so the loss is not self-healing: the discover popup never
 * appears and the dApp times out at 60s.
 *
 * The dApp click must be the FIRST wake event after the kill — no popup is
 * opened, no extension page is touched between the kill and the click.
