/**
 * Imported-account EXECUTION — the end-to-end proof of the credential-rooted imported-key chain
 * on a live sandbox. Prover-on, the transactions carry real proofs; in a proverless run
 * (`NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS=1`, as CI's shards run it) the node accepts them without one.
 *
 * Nothing else executes with a FILE-imported account: `account-import-export.test.ts` proves the
 * file round-trips (address re-derivation), and the unit/integration layers prove sealing —
 * but "the stored ciphertext, unsealed under the profile DEK, reconstructs a signing key that a
 * real node accepts a transaction from" only falls out of doing exactly that:
 *
 *   1. Browser 1 (profile A, token-ready): A executes one self-transfer — its FIRST tx, which
 *      runs the frozen ctor via the deploy path and leaves the account contract DEPLOYED. Then
 *      A's account is exported to a NULO-ACCOUNT-EXPORT file body.
 *   2. Browser 2 (profile B, a DIFFERENT master): imports the file — the signing key is sealed
 *      under B's DEK, the row is B's — switches to the imported account, and self-transfers.
 *      That signature comes from the unsealed imported key; simulate, prove, node
 *      acceptance, confirmed activity row.
 *
 * A executes FIRST on purpose: the imported account's tx in B is then a post-deploy tx, so this
 * file proves the DEK→unseal→sign chain in isolation rather than compounding it with the
 * cross-PXE lazy-deploy path (its own surface, covered by the canaries for derived accounts).
 *
 * The SECOND test is the PASSKEY variant. A passkey profile's DEK is sealed under the
 * PRF-derived wrap key, not a passhash — and account EXPORT is password-gated by design, so the
 * re-export-preview probe the smoke suites use cannot exist for passkey profiles. Execution is
 * therefore the ONLY end-to-end proof of the passkey-rooted imported-key chain: PRF ceremony →
 * wrap key → DEK unseal → row unseal → sign → prove → mined. The import additionally
 * survives a full lock → ceremony-unlock cycle before signing, so the row is proven against a
 * RE-unsealed DEK, not the still-warm session that imported it. FTN discipline applies (see the
 * canary): every ceremony runs on the anchor popup, which stays open for the whole test.
 *
 * Run solo: `bun run e2e:agent tests/e2e/network/imported-account-execution.test.ts`.
