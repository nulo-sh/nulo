/**
 * `bun run e2e:reap` — session-end cleanup for local e2e runs.
 *
 * The teardown stack + next-run orphan reap only fire when a run exits cleanly or when the NEXT run
 * boots. When you stop running e2e (walk away after a burst, `git worktree remove` a throwaway
 * baseline), the last runs' sandboxes are never reaped — and each orphaned aztec process holds its
 * multi-GB data dir open, which under the old tmpfs layout pinned that space in RAM until the box
 * thrashed. This script is the explicit "clean up after myself" step:
 *
 *   1. Reap THIS worktree's owned run (from `.e2e-state/owned.json`): kill the recorded process
 *      groups, remove the recorded data dir, clear the lock.
 *   2. Sweep {@link E2E_DATA_ROOT} for orphaned `nulo-aztec-<pid>-*` dirs whose owning process is
 *      DEAD, and remove them (live pids are skipped, so a concurrent agent's run is never touched).
 *
 *   3. Release Firefox launches (geckodriver, its Firefox, the profile) whose owning test run is
 *      gone — otherwise they wait for the next Firefox launch on this host to sweep them.
 *
 * Ownership-scoped by design: it only kills pids this worktree's lock recorded and only deletes
 * data dirs whose owner is gone — never a blanket `pkill -f aztec` that could hit another agent.
