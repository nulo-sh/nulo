# E2E test suite

Three vitest configs live next to this README:

| Config | Suite | Boots a sandbox? |
|---|---|---|
| `vitest.e2e.config.ts` | Smoke (`tests/e2e/*.test.ts`) | No |
| `vitest.e2e.network.config.ts` | Network (`tests/e2e/network/**`) | Yes — anvil + aztec + playground |
| `vitest.e2e.all.config.ts` | Smoke + network | Yes |

The smoke suite drives the extension UI without an Aztec node and runs from any worktree. The network suite expects a per-run anvil + aztec sandbox + playground; this README focuses on it.

## Running locally

The agent wrapper handles port allocation, the wallet build, and the test invocation in one shot:

```bash
bun run e2e:agent                                    # full network suite
bun run e2e:agent --reporter=verbose                 # extra args go to vitest
bun run e2e:agent tests/e2e/network/transfers.test.ts # filter to one file
bun run e2e:agent --shard=5/5                        # reproduce one CI shard (see "CI sharding")
```

Both suites run on Chrome by default and on Firefox with `NULO_E2E_BROWSER=firefox` (`bun run test:e2e` for smoke, `bun run e2e:agent …` for network). One run drives one browser: the agent builds `dist/<browser>`, greps that bundle and loads that extension. Firefox needs `geckodriver` (on `PATH` or at `$GECKODRIVER`) and `bun x puppeteer browsers install firefox`. How it is driven, what behaves differently and the rule for absorbing a difference: [`FIREFOX.md`](./FIREFOX.md).

Internally `scripts/e2e/agent.sh`:

1. Calls `scripts/e2e/resolve-ports.ts` to allocate five ephemeral TCP ports (anvil, aztec, aztec admin, aztec p2p, playground) and persists them to `.e2e-state/ports.json`.
2. Builds the extension for the run's browser with `VITE_LOCAL_NETWORK_RPC_URL=http://localhost:<aztec port>` so the wallet's "Local Network" preset talks to this run's sandbox.
3. Greps the bundle for the URL — fails fast if the vite env didn't propagate.
4. Runs the network suite with `ANVIL_URL` / `ANVIL_PORT` / `AZTEC_NODE_URL` / `AZTEC_PORT` / `AZTEC_ADMIN_PORT` / `AZTEC_P2P_PORT` / `PLAYGROUND_URL` / `PLAYGROUND_PORT` in env.

`global-setup.ts` reads those env vars, spawns anvil + aztec + playground (each with the assigned port) and writes an ownership lockfile at `.e2e-state/owned.json`. Its `setup` is a short coordinator whose ORDER is the contract — orphan reap + build guard → `reconcilePriorLock` (reuse a healthy pack, or reap a stale one) → provisional lock → `markBootStarted()` (the exit-86 window opens here, AFTER the build/env checks that must never be retried) → `ensureAnvil` → `ensureAztecNode` → `ensureDevServer` (playground) → `finishBoot` (provide URLs, deploy, `markBootReady()`). Each stage probes first and adopts an already-running service; a stage detects a permissive failure and returns `"skip"` (the strict-mode `E2E_REQUIRE_SETUP=1` throws stay inside it), and the coordinator owns the exit (`provideWithoutSandbox` + `return`), so a lost or doubled `provide` is visible in one place. Process handles and the `weStarted*` flags stay module-level, shared with `teardown` and the signal hooks.

### Presto: local vs CI

**Locally** (`bun run e2e:agent`), the wallet's `PrestoProver` (from `@alejoamiras/presto`) probes `https://127.0.0.1:59834/health` — HTTPS only, exactly like production:

- **Presto** (the desktop app) running with its Encrypted Connection set up → native bb proving.
- Nothing, or Presto without HTTPS → silent fallback to in-browser WASM (still works, just slower). The activity card says which (`Proving with Presto ✦` / `Proving in browser…`).

There is no `VITE_NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED` enforcement locally. This matches production behavior — end users without Presto installed get WASM proving without any error.

**In CI** (`pr-extension-network-e2e.yml`), the prover-ON lanes:

1. Install the headless **`presto-server`** binary (Linux x86_64 release from `alejoamiras/presto`; tarball and extracted binary both SHA-256 pinned, single-member archive).
2. Start it on the runner's `127.0.0.1:59833` (plain HTTP — the headless server has no TLS).
3. Build the wallet with `VITE_NULO_PRESTO_REQUIRED=1` → `chain-runtime.ts` constructs `ProductionPxeFactory` in required-mode: plaintext HTTP derived from the mode, eager preflight, `onPhase` throw on every fallback-class phase.
4. Any test where the wallet would have fallen back to WASM fails loudly with `[presto-required] SDK emitted phase="fallback"` (or the more precise `denied` / `secure-connection-unavailable` / `version-mismatch`).

The terminology gap matters: **Presto** is the desktop app a user installs; **presto-server** is the headless binary CI uses. Same HTTP contract, different surface.

**Caveat for local devs running e2e while Presto is running**: the wallet proves through whatever answers `https://127.0.0.1:59834` — usually the desktop app, which will show its Allow/Deny prompt for the unpacked extension's origin at the first prove (development builds share one extension id via the manifest `key`, so the approval sticks across worktrees). If a test must not touch the native prover, quit the desktop app before `bun run e2e:agent`.

### Proverless mode

`NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS=1 bun run e2e:agent <file>` builds the wallet with `proverEnabled:false` (skips BB-SNARK generation; kernel simulation + on-chain submission stay real — the local node accepts the fake proof). Much faster than real proving, and Presto-independent (it's forced off). The agent arms the double-opt-in flags + asserts the proverless build stamp. Most CI shards run this way.

The **default-token seeding** spec (`network/default-token-seeding.test.ts`) needs a seed entry for the sandbox, which mints a fresh token address every run — so no build-time list can name it. `VITE_NULO_E2E_TOKEN_SEEDS` + `VITE_NULO_E2E_TOKEN_SEEDS_CONFIRM` (double opt-in, fail-closed; set by `agent.sh`) swap `TokenSeederDeps.getSeeds()` for a `chrome.storage.session` reader on key `nulo:e2e:token-seeds`, written via `seedSandboxDefaultToken` in `fixtures/token-seeds.ts`. The reader **replaces** the shipped seed list and accepts exactly one `chainId: 0` entry with canonical hex fields, pinning `expectedSymbol` to `"TST"`, `expectedDecimals` to 18 and the placeholder label `displayName` to `"TestToken"` itself — the label is rendered before the chain answers, so storage must not be able to supply it. The spec also traces, from inside the popup, that the `token-seed-row` placeholder shows before the `tokens-card` and that `tokens-empty-import-link` never appears in between. Replacement is deliberate: every profile registration triggers a seed pass, so with a shipped Testnet seed an augmenting list would have each e2e profile calling the public dRPC endpoint. `_extension-smoke-e2e.yml` arms the same pair with **no** key (empty list) on its source build for that reason. Artifact-mode smoke runs the shipped list as built: its browser blackholes only the price host (`NULO_E2E_ARTIFACT_RUN` in `fixtures/browser/`), so each of its profiles seeds the shipped Testnet tokens through dRPC. That is accepted: it is the one run of the shipped list against the live chain before a release. A spec that measures anything below Home's token list first waits for `tokens-list` to carry `data-settled="true"` with nothing in it loading (`waitForSettledTokens` in `rows.test.ts`). Both literals are in the `_build-extension.yml` negative grep, and `agent.sh` + `_extension-smoke-e2e.yml` grep for them positively — an unused export can tree-shake away even in an armed build, which would make the release guard a false negative.

The **STUB** tests (`cancel-mid-prove`, `concurrent-sendtx-{approve,confirm}`, `lock-cancels-dapp-send`, `auto-lock-defers-while-proving`, `profile-switch-sweeps-transfer`) hold the tx at `proving` via a `ProofGate` barrier (`holdProofGate`/`releaseProofGate` in `fixtures/proof-gate.ts`, backed by `chrome.storage.session` key `nulo:e2e:proof-gate`) so the sub-second proverless prove still gives a deterministic window. Real BB proving is guarded by the prover-ON `network-e2e-canary` CI job (`transfers` + `tx-sendTx-default`); see [CI.md § Proverless network e2e](../../../../CI.md). Full design: [`implementations-plan/archive/e2e-proverless-stub/`](../../../../implementations-plan/archive/e2e-proverless-stub/plan.md).

### Store captures (opt-in)

`tests/e2e/network/store-captures.test.ts` is skipped unless `STORE_CAPTURES=1`, and always on
Firefox. It stages a wallet on the sandbox through the UI (a "Testnet"-named network, USD Coin and
Fee Juice, a contact, two receipts and a private send) and writes the popup captures
`scripts/store-art.ts` frames for the store listings into `store/captures/`: `home`, `send`,
`history`, `security` and `approve`, at 360×600 and 2× (720×1200 PNGs). Proverless is enough, since
no frame shows a proof:

```bash
STORE_CAPTURES=1 NULO_E2E_PROVERLESS=1 bun run e2e:agent tests/e2e/network/store-captures.test.ts
cd apps/extension && bun scripts/store-art.ts
```

## Running multiple agents in parallel

Open one terminal per worktree and run `bun run e2e:agent` in each. Each agent allocates fresh ports and owns its own anvil + aztec + playground:

```bash
# terminal 1 — worktree A
bun run e2e:agent

# terminal 2 — worktree B
bun run e2e:agent
```

Verify with `lsof`:

```bash
lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P | grep -E "anvil|node"
```

You should see two of each, on different ports. The Chrome processes are scoped via `--load-extension=$EXTENSION_PATH` so the orphan-cleanup `pkill` in setup only kills *this* worktree's chromes.

### Verified concurrent run

Two-worktree proof of isolation:

| Worktree | Port pack (anvil, aztec, admin, p2p, pg) | Token contract deployed |
|---|---|---|
| worktree A   | `49522, 49523, 49524, 49525, 49526` | `0x0693fd819c9dd798…` |
| worktree B   | `49527, 49528, 49529, 49530, 49531` | `0x1c477acbeea157c9…` |

Both ran `bun run e2e:agent tests/e2e/network/meta-getChainInfo.test.ts` simultaneously. Both passed `1/1` in ~40s wall. The distinct token-contract addresses prove the runs deployed against independent PXE state.

## Single-worktree fast iteration

If you `bun run vitest run --config vitest.e2e.network.config.ts` directly with stable env vars (e.g. `AZTEC_PORT=8080` etc.), `global-setup.ts` will reuse a still-healthy sandbox from the previous run instead of cold-starting:

- the lockfile must exist
- the recorded ports + baked URL must match the current env
- the recorded PIDs must still be alive
- the candidate sandbox must report the same L1 contract addresses recorded post-deploy (proves we're talking to *our* sandbox, not a stranger that drifted onto the same port)

If any check fails, setup reaps the stale children and cold-starts a fresh stack. `bun run e2e:agent` always allocates fresh ports, so it never hits the reuse path — the lockfile only serves orphan cleanup there.

## CI sharding (5-way matrix)

CI runs the network suite as a **5-shard GitHub Actions matrix** (`.github/workflows/pr-extension-network-e2e.yml`). Each shard:

- Is its own ubuntu-latest VM — own anvil, own aztec node, own playground vite, own Chrome
- Gets roughly a fifth of the network test files (80 files today, 1 of them an env-gated probe skipped by default), assigned deterministically by vitest's `--shard=N/M` (SHA-1 hash of filename); the six files with a dedicated lane (`fee-methods`, `selfpay-phase`, `concurrent-sendtx-confirm`, `transfers`, `tx-sendTx-default`, `frozen-account-canary`) are excluded from the pool — `scripts/ci-cd/behavior-gating.test.ts` pins that list against the lanes
- Runs in parallel with the other 4 shards

**Wall time**: ~10–15 min (vs ~35–45 min unsharded). CPU minutes: ~25% more than serial (each shard pays the ~30s anvil+aztec boot cost), but the wall-time win is dramatic.

**Why N=5 and not N=4 or N=9**: legacy reasoning from when `tx-sendTx-multicall` and `multi-account-from` were collision-sensitive under WASM proving. N=4 collided them on the same shard, blowing the shard timeout; N=5 separated them. With the accelerator the per-prove time is bounded enough that the collision concern no longer holds — N=5 is preserved for now as the stable shape, but could be tuned in a future PR.

**Dedicated heavy jobs**: a few files run OUTSIDE the shard pool on their own runner (`test_files` on a dedicated job, mirrored in the pool's `exclude_files` — `scripts/ci-cd/behavior-gating.test.ts` pins the two lists equal): `fee-methods` + `selfpay-phase` (`Run / heavy`), `concurrent-sendtx-confirm` (`Run / heavy / concurrent-confirm`), and the prover-ON canary files. `selfpay-phase` is the wallet's setup-phase / account-identity gate: `Token.mint_to_private` (the bridge hub claim's inner call — a private call enqueueing a non-allow-listed public finalisation) simulated and sent as each of two granted accounts, never-sent and deployed, self-paid from public Fee Juice and via the PrivateFPC (fuel, then credit), with the node's tx validation ON, plus a negative control that must draw the node's `Setup function not on allow list`. Its cheap sibling `sim-from-selfpay` (one self-paid simulate as the second granted account) stays in the shard pool. Both run at `retry: "0"`; both are driven through the playground's `Simulation` and `Self-pay phase` sections, whose simulate results are projected by `apps/playground/src/lib/simulation-summary.ts` (fee payer, private frames, public calls per phase) because the raw kernel output is not feed-readable.

**Failing shard logs**: each shard uploads its own artifact (`network-e2e-logs-<N>-of-5`) containing `.e2e-state`, `aztec-*.log`, `anvil-*.log`, `presto-server.log`, `presto-health.json` on failure.

**Reproducing a CI shard locally**: pass `--shard=N/5` to `e2e:agent`:

```bash
bun run e2e:agent --shard=5/5                                  # just the files in shard 5
```

Vitest's deterministic SHA-1-of-filename sharder picks the same files locally as in CI, so this is the fastest way to reproduce a shard-specific failure (e.g. "register-token only fails on shard 1"). Each invocation still starts its own anvil + aztec + playground; running multiple shards in parallel needs multiple worktrees (see "Running multiple agents in parallel" above).

**Slow-prove tests**: `tx-sendTx-default`, `multi-account-from` and `tx-sendTx-multicall` run on CI even though the WASM kernel-prove tail can exceed puppeteer's 300s `protocolTimeout` on slow runners: those tests and the `tx-sendTx-{noFrom,feePayer,sponsoredFpc}` siblings assert on the wallet's journal `proving` stage via `waitForSendTxActiveStage()` instead of waiting on the dApp's full sendTx promise. See `implementations-plan/archive/journal-stage-restructure/`.

**Known limitation: cold-shard rotation.** Each shard starts with a fresh anvil + aztec + playground + Chrome + extension. The FIRST capability-popup-driven test in shard 1 (whichever file the SHA-1 sharder puts first) pays a cold-SW penalty — `chrome.windows.create` + bb.js init + PXE warmup can push that test past its budget. Quarantining the offender just exposes the next file as the new "first" victim. The structural fix is a fixture-level warm-up tap or pre-grant-capability fixture, which is not built yet. Single-shard re-runs (or local repro via `--shard=N/5`) usually pass green once the SW is warm; `extension-network-e2e-status` is a required check on `dev` and `main`, so a cold-shard red is re-run, never neutralized.

## Troubleshooting

**`FATAL: built bundle does not contain http://localhost:<port>`** — vite didn't substitute `import.meta.env.VITE_LOCAL_NETWORK_RPC_URL`. Confirm `vite.config.ts` exposes the `VITE_*` env (this is on by default; the build wrapper passes the env via `VITE_LOCAL_NETWORK_RPC_URL=... bun run build:chrome`).

**`Timed out waiting for anvil at …`** — the bundled anvil binary failed to bind. Check `lsof -ti:<anvil port>` for an unrelated process. Re-run `bun run e2e:agent` to allocate a fresh port.

**`prior sandbox identity mismatch — tearing down and starting fresh`** — a previous run's sandbox died and a foreign process took over its port. Setup detects this via the L1-contract-address check and recovers automatically.

**`reaped orphan <name> pid=<n>`** — a previous agent run left children alive (Ctrl-C, OOM). Setup found them through the lockfile and reaped them. No action needed.

**Manual cleanup of stale state.** Delete `.e2e-state/` in the worktree, then `pkill -f "anvil.*--port"` and `pkill -f "aztec.*start.*--local-network"` if you suspect leftover processes.

## Terms-acceptance state

`launchExtension({ legal })` seeds the device-local acceptance record, built by `@nulo/legal`'s own
`applyAcceptance`: `current` (default on a fresh profile), `missing`, `stale`, `corrupt`, or `keep`
(default on a reused `userDataDir`, so a relaunch keeps what the last launch left).
`openOnboarding(ctx, { legal: "missing" })` gives the gate's specs a real fresh install, and
`reloadWithLegalState(page, seed)` flips a running wallet. The scenarios live in
`legal-acceptance.test.ts` (S1–S9) and `network/legal-acceptance-wall.test.ts` (N1).

## Helper conventions (CDP regression workarounds)

A Puppeteer/Chrome interaction layer regressed somewhere between sandbox ABI versions; e2e helpers in `fixtures/extension.ts` and `fixtures/helpers.ts` work around it. **Do not bypass these helpers** — calling raw `page.click()` / `handle.click()` / `page.waitForFunction()` directly will reintroduce flakes that look like timeouts but are actually CDP / rAF-throttling issues.

| Helper | Use it instead of | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `clickByTestId(page, id)` / `clickSelector(page, sel)` | `(await page.waitForSelector(...))!.click()` and `handle.click()` | The CDP element-handle click hangs with `Runtime.callFunctionOn timed out`. Synthetic in-page click via `page.evaluate(() => el.click())` bypasses the broken protocol path. |
| `typeIntoInput` / `replaceInputValue` | `handle.type(text)` | Same CDP path, same hang. The helper sets `value` via the prototype setter and dispatches `input` events. |
| `patchPagePolling(page)` (auto-applied by `launchExtension`, `openPopup`, `openPlayground`, `waitForPopup`) | manually configuring polling on every `page.waitForFunction` call | Default `'raf'` polling is throttled in offscreen / unfocused tabs. Patch defaults to `polling: 200`. `waitForSelector` (CSS-only) is rerouted through the patched `waitForFunction` for the same reason; prefixed selectors (`text/`, `xpath/`, `aria/`, `pierce/`) are left alone. |
| `pointerClick(page, testid, { last? })` (`helpers/legal-drivers.ts`) | `clickByTestId` when the assertion is "nothing covers this control" | An in-page click reaches a covered element. This one hit-tests the control's centre, fails naming whatever sits on top, then clicks through `page.mouse` (`Input.dispatchMouseEvent`, not the hanging element-handle path). `last` picks the last match — the control of the popup on top of a stack. |
| `coveredAt` / `activeTestId` / `waitForFocus` / `tabAround(page, n)` (`helpers/pointer-probes.ts`) | reasoning about z-index or `offsetParent`; reading focus right after a close | What the pointer would hit at a control's centre, where focus is, where it lands (a released trap hands focus back on a timer — wait, never read), and where `n` Tabs take it — the browser facts behind "this popup covers that one" and "the trap holds". |
| `closeStuckPopup(page)` | waiting for the popup to unmount after a confirm/submit | Vue `<Transition>` sticks mid-enter / mid-leave under headless Chrome rAF throttling — `slide-enter-from + slide-enter-active` never advances. Helper force-removes the `#popup` teleport children + dim backdrop AFTER asserting the actual post-mutation signal (row appeared, contact deleted, etc.). |
| `settleClosedPopup(page, innerTestId)` (`fixtures/popup-leave.ts`) | `closeStuckPopup` when another popup must stay open beneath | The scoped form: waits for the closed popup's DOM to leave or for its leave to have begun, then finishes only that one by hand. Returns whether it had to. |
| `withTimeoutMessage(wait, message)` | `.catch(() => { throw new Error("...") })` around a wait | A bare catch relabels frame detaches, CDP disconnects and page crashes as "the state never settled", burying a real fault under a plausible-looking flake. This converts `TimeoutError` only, rethrows everything else untouched, and keeps the original as `cause`. Pass a function when the message has to read live page state — prefer that form, so the failure says what WAS observed. |

Feature helpers in `fixtures/helpers.ts` (all `data-testid`-driven; reuse them rather than re-deriving the click sequence):

| Helper | Does |
|---|---|
| `clickNavTab(page, "general" \| "holdings" \| "activity" \| "settings")` / `openHoldings(page)` | Bottom-nav navigation, waits for the route hash. |
| `navigateToTokenDetail(page, symbol?)` | Opens a token page from its Home card (`symbol` picks the card when more than one token is listed). |
| `importToken(page, contract)` + `captureBalanceBaseline` / `waitForFreshBalanceRow` | Imports a token and waits for its projected balance row — pair them for every import so assertions never race the projector. |
| `selectSendToken(page, symbol)` | On the Send page, picks a token in the picker and waits for the trigger to show it. |
| `pinFromTokenPage(page)` / `readPinState(page)` | Token page "⋯" menu: toggle Pin to Home; read the item's `data-pinned`. |
| `deployExtraTokensForAccount(config, account, [{ symbol, amount }])` (`fixtures/aztec.ts`) | Deploys and mints extra sandbox tokens for multi-token scenarios. |
| `readPublicTokenBalance` / `readPublicFeeJuice(wallet, from, …)` (`fixtures/aztec.ts`) | Chain-side balance reads through the script wallet — the postcondition for "executed as account X" (the token moved from X, nobody else's balances moved), since receipts carry no sender. |
| `grantCapBundle(ctx, page, bundle, pick)` + `approveCapabilities(popup, { accounts })` | Drives the capability popup. On a repeat `accounts` request for a session that already holds accounts, held rows render `data-granted="true"`, pre-selected and locked (a click is ignored); `approveCapabilities` only clicks rows that are not yet selected, so pass the NEW addresses. |
| `requestPgBundle(page, bundle, { tokenAddress })` + `readCapabilitySwitch(popup, rowKey)` / `approveCapabilities(popup, { switches })` / `setConnectedAppAuthorizations(page, host, on)` (`fixtures/playground.ts`, `fixtures/popups.ts`) | The consent switches. A scoped bundle names the contract in `tokenAddress` (without one it carries `"0x0"`, which the wallet refuses). A new card's switch is found by its `data-cap-row` (`authorizations`, `address-book`, `private-events`, `unknown`); an "Already granted" card has none. The Settings helper finds the app by the host its session was made on, then reopens the page to prove the stored state. `readStoredCapability(ctx, origin, type)` (`fixtures/dappSession.ts`) reads what the grant stored. |
| `lockWallet(page)` / `lockThroughConfirmDialog(page)` / `waitForLockScreen(page)` | Lock from the header. `lockWallet` expects no approved send running; with one running the button asks first, and `lockThroughConfirmDialog` confirms that dialog and returns its copy. Both wait for the session record to go, then for `/popup/auth`. |
| `createAndActivateProfile(page, name, password)` | Creates a profile from the lock screen's picker, which activates it; asserts the field opened prefilled `Profile N` before typing `name`; returns its id. |
| `waitForNameField` / `expectNoNameField` / `expectNameFieldPrefill` (`fixtures/extension.ts`) + `readProfileNames` | The Profile-name rule on the four profile-creating pages (root testids `onboarding-create-page`, `onboarding-import-page`, `register-page`, `import-page`, state in `data-name-field`): a first profile has no field and is named "Main"; a later one shows it prefilled `Profile N`. Wait for the state before typing: the field renders only once the profile list is read. `importSeed(…, { profileName })` types a name only when given and fails when given one on a first profile. |
| `readSessionRow` / `waitForSessionRow` / `peekSession` / `setSessionTtlMs(page, ms)` | Session state without navigating (a navigation refreshes the session): the persisted row's `profile`/`since`/`lockedAt`, the profile service's own expiry check, and a millisecond auto-lock TTL through the config service. |
| `readSendRecords` / `waitForSendRecord(page, match)` (`fixtures/journal.ts`) | Every profile's `transfer` and `dapp_execute` journal records with their stage and `enteredProveAt` — the anchor for proof-gate timing. |
| `sendTransfer(page, { …, expect })` + `fillSendForm(page, { amount, destination })` | Drives a whole send. `expect` (`"send"` \| `"review"`) is the caller's claim about the footer: a send the fee card gates (the account's own Fee Juice under a private origin) goes through the review sheet, anything else at once — the other offer throws. Every call site states it. |
| `openSend` / `readSendView` / `waitForFee` / `waitForTag` / `submitSend` / `openReviewFromStrip` / `readReview` / `waitForReviewReady` / `shotSend` (`fixtures/send-page.ts`) | The Send page's publish surface: the strip's cells, the fee-source tag and the footer's action read together — `assertPublishInvariant` refuses a page where they disagree — plus the review sheet's rows, the hit-tested clicks on "Review send" / "Send now" / the strip, and both-theme screenshots under `NULO_E2E_SHOT_DIR`. |

Anti-throttle Chrome flags live in `launchExtension` (`extension.ts`):

```
--disable-renderer-backgrounding
--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows
--disable-features=CalculateNativeWinOcclusion
```

`protocolTimeout: 300_000` is set on the browser launch; this is a safety net, not a fix — the helpers above are the actual fix.

## Known failures + triage

The network suite is a required PR gate at retry 0 (`extension-network-e2e-status`); there is no standing list of failing files. Open flake fingerprints, their sanctioned responses, and the history of every root-caused one live in the flake ledger of the `e2e-testing` skill (`.claude/skills/e2e-testing/SKILL.md` § Flake ledger). A red gate is a known fingerprint → rerun once, or breakage → fix; never a neutralised check.

## What's owned per worktree (parallel-safety summary)
