	// SKIP — three distinct blockers, all measured, none of them "flaky CI":
	//  1. The original setup was dead. It flipped strictSecurityMode by posting to
	//     ConfigService over `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`, but wallet services listen
	//     on PORTS: the SW's only onMessage listener (`src/wallet/index.ts`) returns
	//     false. A probe confirmed the call resolves with no reply and `nulo:config`
	//     is never written, so strict mode stayed ON and the silent restore asserted
	//     here could not occur. The test only ever "passed" because the old kill left
	//     the worker running, so nothing needed restoring.
	//  2. Driving the real Settings → Lock toggle instead (below, kept for the
	//     next attempt) gets further but stalls: the page's `onBeforeMount` awaits two
	//     `configService.getValue` calls and `isLoading` never clears within 10s in
	//     this post-unlock, post-restart context, so `strict-security-toggle` never
	//     renders. That points at the config client's reconnect lifecycle after an
	//     unlock — its own investigation, not a wait to lengthen.
	//  3. Reaching settings via the nav tab additionally races the routing the unlock
	//     is still finishing; hash navigation avoids that but does not fix (2).
	// The other three tests in this file are un-skipped and green.
