/**
 * Ownership records for launched WebDriver processes.
 *
 * Many agents share this host, so teardown must kill exactly what this launch started and nothing
 * else: no `pkill -f geckodriver`, which would take down a neighbour's run and leave it believing
 * its browser crashed.
 *
 * Identity is a random marker in the launch's environment, which every process it starts
 * inherits. Numbers cannot carry it: a pid is reissued once its process is gone, a pgid once its
 * group is, and an orphan's record sits unattended for exactly the interval in which that happens
 * — so neither "the leader's start time matches" nor "the group still has members" proves the
 * processes found are the ones recorded. A marker also follows a child that leaves the group.
 *
 * Records live on real disk, not tmpfs: a run killed before teardown must leave a record the next
 * run can read, and a profile directory under `/tmp` would be RAM-backed and pinned open by the
 * very process that failed to exit.
