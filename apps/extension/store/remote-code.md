# What runs in the wallet that did not ship in the package

Both stores ask whether the extension executes remote code. This note describes, with file
references, what arrives from outside, what executes it, and what it can and cannot reach, so the
declaration ("No remote code", on both stores) rests on a stated mechanism rather than on a slogan.
`scripts/store-listing.test.ts` checks that every `path:line` cited here exists.

## What arrives

An application connected over the wallet-sdk channel can register a contract: an **instance**
(address preimage) and, optionally, an **artifact** (`packages/wallet-bridge/src/dispatcher.ts:1099-1106`).
The artifact is a JSON document: an ABI plus, per function, one ACIR program with any Brillig code
inside it (`@aztec-labs/stdlib/src/abi/abi.ts:273-274`). The wallet parses it against a schema before storing it
(`packages/aztec-runtime/src/pxe/service.ts:440-465`) and derives the contract address from the
preimage, refusing a mismatch. The artifact is **data**: it is never evaluated as JavaScript, never
injected into a page, never loaded as a script.

## What executes it

Contract functions run inside the Aztec PXE, hosted in a hidden extension document (Chrome's
offscreen document, or a frame of the background page on Firefox,
`apps/extension/src/wallet/utils/offscreen.ts:36-43`). The PXE feeds each function's bytecode to
the ACVM, a virtual machine compiled to WebAssembly and bundled in the package
(`@aztec-labs/simulator/src/private/acvm_wasm.ts:89-97`;
`@aztec-labs/pxe/src/contract_function_simulator/oracle/private_execution.ts:48`). That the WASM is
the bundled copy is a property of the loaders, not of the policy: the ACVM glue instantiates
`acvm_js_bg.wasm` from its own module URL (`@aztec-foundation/noir-acvm_js/web/acvm_js.js:924`, an asset
Vite emits next to it), and the prover's loader is replaced by a shim that fetches
`/assets/barretenberg.wasm.gz` from the extension's own origin
(`apps/extension/src/shims/bb-fetch-code.ts:15-18`). The content security policy,
`script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` under `default-src 'self'`
(`apps/extension/manifest/manifest.config.ts:47-62`), forbids remote scripts, `eval` and
`Function()`. The one upstream package that built a function from a string with no fallback,
`function-bind`, is replaced by a stub for that reason
(`apps/extension/src/shims/function-bind-stub.cjs:1-26`); zod's compiler is switched off before
any schema is built (`apps/extension/src/utils/zod-jitless.ts:12-14`), and the others that try
(msgpackr, get-intrinsic) catch the refusal and fall back. But `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` permits
compiling WASM bytes from any source and `connect-src` admits any HTTPS host, so the policy does not
by itself prove where the bytes came from; the loaders above do.

## What the bytecode can reach

**Directly: nothing outside the VM.** The ACVM interprets an arithmetic circuit; a Brillig
opcode can request a *foreign call*, and the only foreign-call handler is the one built over the
wallet's own oracle: `buildACIRCallback` maps each registered oracle name to a method of the handler
it is given and nothing else (`@aztec-labs/pxe/src/contract_function_simulator/oracle/acir_callback.ts:24-96`).

**Through the oracle, the calls it serves.** Utility functions get the methods of
`@aztec-labs/pxe/src/contract_function_simulator/oracle/utility_execution_oracle.ts` (the public
methods from `:200` on, among them random fields, key validation, membership witnesses, block headers, contract
instances, auth witnesses, the caller's own notes and nullifiers, capsules and fact collections,
logging, nested utility calls). Private functions add the methods of
`@aztec-labs/pxe/src/contract_function_simulator/oracle/private_execution_oracle.ts` (from `:117`, among
them context inputs, note creation and nullification notices, tagging secrets, hash preimages, log
emission). Some of those answers are fetched from the Aztec node the user configured — for example
a public-storage read (`@aztec-labs/pxe/src/contract_function_simulator/oracle/utility_execution_oracle.ts:547-558`) becomes
`getPublicStorageAt` requests, and membership witnesses become the corresponding node queries
(`:264`, `:291`, `:321`, `:343`, `:361`, `:389`, `:518`). So a contract function **can cause
requests to leave the device, to one fixed endpoint it does not choose**, carrying what it
queries: addresses, storage slots, hashes and log tags. It cannot name a host, send a body of its choosing, or read the response of
anything but the typed query the oracle made on its behalf.

**What it cannot reach:** extension APIs (`chrome.*`), the DOM of any page, the popup, storage
outside the PXE database, the network by any path other than the oracle above, and any host other
than the configured node. The host document itself talks to the service worker over
`chrome.runtime` messaging (`apps/extension/src/offscreen/index.ts:109`) and exposes no page-facing
surface.

## When it runs without a click

A connected application's calls go through the interaction service. `isConfirmationNeeded`
(`apps/extension/src/wallet/services/dapp-interaction/service.ts:686-715`) shows the confirmation
popup when the call's access level reaches the session's confirmation level, when a send spends the
account's own Fee Juice (it names no fee payer, or pays itself), and always for token registration; the wallet-sdk session is created at
`AccessLevel.Transactions` (`apps/extension/src/wallet/services/wallet-sdk/background.ts:1081`), so
sends prompt. Auth-witness creation prompts too, unless the user let that application sign, without
asking, the authorizations its granted scopes cover: a consent stored on the session
(`packages/wallet-bridge/src/dispatcher.ts:604-628`). Simulations and utility calls at lower
levels run silently for a session the user already approved
(`apps/extension/src/wallet/services/dapp-interaction/service.ts:430-431`). A silent utility call can
therefore execute application-supplied bytecode and, through the oracle, cause node reads, with no
per-request window. What it cannot do is any of the things listed above.

## What this bears on

`legal/privacy.md` says in § 13 "The extension loads no remote code" (`legal/privacy.md:346-347`).
That sentence is true under the reading above — code is what the browser executes as script or
WASM, and the package bundles all of it. § 2 credits the content security policy only with what it
delivers, "forbids loading remote scripts" (`legal/privacy.md:48-49`): `script-src 'self'` forbids
remote *scripts*, while `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` permits compiling WASM bytes from any source, and it is
the bundled loaders above, not the policy, that keep the WASM local. The Firefox reviewer notes and
the Chrome remote-code justification in `store/listing.md` summarise this note and rest on the § 13
sentence.
