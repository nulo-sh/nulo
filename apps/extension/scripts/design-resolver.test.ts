/**
 * Resolver-inventory pin. `NULO_DESIGN_COMPONENTS` must equal EXACTLY
 * the set of names the extension routes to `@nulo/design` — NOT "every package export" (the package
 * also exports names the extension never routes, e.g. the wrapper bases `SubPageHeaderBase`/
 * `ToastManagerBase`, which must never enter the resolver). Wrapper-backed names (`Button`/`SubPageHeader`/`ToastManager`)
 * stay local and must be ABSENT (else the bare tag resolves to the package base instead of the wrapper).
 *
 * Every listed name has had its extension-local SFC deleted: a local shadow wins the bare tag over
 * the package version, which the "no local shadow" test below refuses. Typecheck catches a missing export; this pins against a
 * wrong/extra remap AND a re-introduced shadow. Grow `EXPECTED_MIGRATED` in the SAME PR that deletes a
 * local SFC + adds the name to the resolver.
