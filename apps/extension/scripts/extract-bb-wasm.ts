/**
 * Extract barretenberg WASM bytes from the installed `@aztec-foundation/bb.js` package
 * for build-time copy into `dist/<browser>/assets/`.
 *
 * Why: bb.js@4.2.0 ships its WASM in two forms — a standalone `.wasm.gz`
 * (under `dest/node/...`) and a JS module with the bytes inlined as a
 * base64-gzip data URI (under `dest/browser/.../fetch_code/browser/`).
 * The Nulo extension runs bb.js inside the MV3 service worker via a
 * custom shim (`src/shims/bb-fetch-code.ts`) that does `fetch()` against
 * `/assets/barretenberg{,-threads}.wasm.gz` — so the build needs to
 * place those two files in `dist/<browser>/assets/`.
 *
 * **Threads variant**: copy `dest/node/barretenberg_wasm/barretenberg-threads.wasm.gz`
 * directly. Verified byte-identical to the threads data-URI payload in
 * the browser-inlined JS module at the time of writing.
 *
 * **Singlethreaded variant**: parse the data URI from
 * `dest/browser/barretenberg_wasm/fetch_code/browser/barretenberg.js`,
 * base64-decode (the bytes are already gzip-encoded — DON'T gunzip+regzip),
 * and write to disk.
 *
 * **Hash assertion**: byte-compare the threads node `.wasm.gz` against
 * the threads browser data URI payload. If they ever diverge upstream,
 * fail the build loud — that means we can no longer trust the simpler
 * "use the node variant" path for the threads file, and the build needs
 * to switch to extracting both variants from the inlined JS.
