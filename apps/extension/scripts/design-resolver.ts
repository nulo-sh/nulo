 * Component names that have moved into `@nulo/design`. The extension's templates still use them as
 * bare tags (`<Flex>`, `<Icon>`…); this resolver maps those names to the package so the
 * dir-scan auto-import keeps working with zero call-site churn after the local SFCs are deleted.
 * Shared by the build (`vite.config.ts`) and Storybook (`.storybook/main.ts`) so the list can't drift.
 * Grows as later phases migrate more components.
