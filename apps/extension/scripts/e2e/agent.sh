# worth protecting - and a DEFERRED trap that fires after the child completes would clobber the
# real classified exit (a green 25-min run reported as 130, or an exit-86 that must trigger the
# CI retry swallowed). Pre-vitest this script owns NO processes (spawns happen inside vitest's
# global-setup), and a trap reading owned.json in that window would kill a PRIOR/CONCURRENT run's
# recorded pids. Sandbox lifecycle is owned end-to-end by the TypeScript side: vitest's wired
# global teardown (KILL-escalated, ownership-gated) + its signal hooks + the next run's
# liveness-checked orphan reap via the progressively-written lock.
