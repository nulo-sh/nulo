 * Boot-failure classifier CLI. Invoked by `agent.sh` with vitest's exit code as
 * argv[2]; reads the boot markers and exits with the classified code so
 * `_extension-network-e2e.yml` can retry ONLY a genuine infra-boot failure (exit 86).
 *
 * The pure {@link classifyExit} logic lives in `tests/e2e/sentinel.ts` and is
 * unit-tested in `classify-exit.test.ts`; this file is only the thin CLI shell.
